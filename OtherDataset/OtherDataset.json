All the light rays coming into the camera can be parameterized by  $(x, y, u, v)$ , where  $(u, v)$  and  $(x, y)$  denote the positions on the aperture and imaging planes, respectively. Therefore, a light field  $L$  is defined over  $(x, y, u, v)$ . We assume that each light ray has only a monochrome intensity; but the extension to RGB color is straight-forward in the-   ory. We also assume that  $x, y, u, v$  take discretized integer values; thus,  $L$  is equivalent to a set of multi-view images, where  $(x, y)$  and  $(u, v)$  respectively denote the pixel position and viewpoint. The arrangement of the viewpoints is assumed to be  $8 \\times 8$   $(u, v \\in \\{1, ..., 8\\})$ . Each element of  $L$  is described using subscripts as  $L_{x,y,u,v}$ . The goal of our method is to reconstruct  $L$  of the target scene from the data measured on the camera in a single exposure.",
