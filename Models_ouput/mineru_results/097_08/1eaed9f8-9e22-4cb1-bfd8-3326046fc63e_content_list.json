Our method performed well with real 3-D scenes； the parallax information was successfully embedded into the events,and a light field was reconstructed with visually convincing quality.Please refer to the supplementary video for more results with better visualization.

We will also extend our method to moving scenes (light field videos)，which would benefit from the time-efficiency of our method. Finally,our method would be extended to a more event-centered direction,where event streams over the continuous time (instead of discretized event stacks) could be fully utilized and light fields could be reconstructed from events alone.
