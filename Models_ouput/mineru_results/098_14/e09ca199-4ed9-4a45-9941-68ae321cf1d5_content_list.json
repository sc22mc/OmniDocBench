The task for GPT-4 is to determine the superior answer or recognize a tie. The chosen examples encompass scenarios where Assistant A performs bettr,Assistant B performs better,and when a tie occurs.This methodology enables us to effectively assess7the model’s quality.Specially,the orders where the model responses are presented to the GPT-4 are swapped randomly to alleviate bias,as Touvron et al.
