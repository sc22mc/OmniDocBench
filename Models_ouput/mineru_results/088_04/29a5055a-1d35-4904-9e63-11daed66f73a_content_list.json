The tree is executed in a top-down manner,allowing the robot to make decisions based on the current state of the environment; goal-oriented action planning isa deliberative architecture that emphasizes planningand goal-directed behavior. Itis based on the idea ofa plan library,which is a set of predefined plans that can be used to achieve specific goals. The robot selects the appropriate plan based on the current goal and the state of the environment. ",

Services can be combined in different ways to create complex systems,making it easier to adapt to changing requirements. ",
