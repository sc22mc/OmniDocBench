(1997) was derived under the assumption of constant entropy, whichisnot generally true inour models.Nevertheless,we still observe astrong correlation betweenthe two quantities,which helpsto providea qualitative explanation for the variation in heavy element nucleosynthesis near $L _ { w } / L _ { \\nu } = 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ .These results are for the same parameters as those in figure7,witha finer grid in $L _ { w } / L _ { \\nu }$ "
