Fruits that are punctured at an early stage develop significant deformities,making them clearly unmarketable.On the other hand,fruits punctured justbefore harvestingmay present internal damages not visible tothenaked eyeat the time of harvestand transfer to the marketplace.Besides compromising the safety of healthy fruit and facilitating the outbreak of other diseases, their presence in the market can undermine consumer confidence in fruit quality. Hence,we recommended integrating nondestructive techniques,such as SWIR,into the fruit sorting system to enhance the quality of marketable fruits by identifying previously undetectable damage at an early stage.

Traditional methods,such as support vector machines,adaptive boosting,and neural networks (NNs) [5], [6],[7],have been widely utilized alongside deep learning techniques based on CNNs [8],[9], [10] to achieve optimal results in insect monitoring.For instance,a novel approach for early detection and continuous monitoring of adult-stage whitefly and thrip in greenhouses has been proposed in [5]. Their approach,based on an image-processing algorithm and artificialNNs,yielded highly satisfactory resultsin whitefly and thrips identification [5].Such approaches hold significant promise in enhancing integrated pestmanagement strategies and in reducing the dependence on harmful chemicals in greenhouse agriculture.In addition, the use of pheromone loaded sticky traps is a common and effective method for autonomously detecting pest infestations[11].

Many images are from the Maryland Biodiversity database [15], and others are from a custom dataset collected by professional cameras.Ichim et al.

Transfer learning and data augmentation are used to reduce computational effort during the learning phase,and statistical indicators (such as precision and recall) derived from confusion matrices are employed to evaluate theperformanceof each CNN.
