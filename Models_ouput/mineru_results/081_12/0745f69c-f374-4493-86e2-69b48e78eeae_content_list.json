If wave shock heating begins before a temperature of around 7GK,the final nucleosynthesis is stronglyimpacted and evenNDWswith modestwave luminosities and fiducial PNS masses can produce a solar-like r-process pattern.If wave shock heating begins below this temperature range,its impacts on nucleosynthesis are muted.For gravito-acoustic waves,the radius of shock formation depends on their frequency, so higher frequency waves are likely to have a larger impact on nucleosynthesis.For higherPNS masses,wave stress contributions can still drive a strong rprocess even if shock heating begins too late to affect seed formation.
