One set of world coordinates consists of the 3D VP/ADPs projected by backprojection [53] using the camera parameters.The other set consists of the 3D points corresponding to these VP/ADPs along the orthogonal Manhattan world coordinates shown in Figure 3. In our case,we focus on rotation without translation and scaling because all 3D points are on a unit sphere.In this fitting，which has a lower computational cost than methods based on a singular value decomposition，we use the optimal linear attitude estimator[34,39], which calculates the Rodrigues vector [13] expressing the principal axis and angle. This Rodrigues vector is compatible with a quaternion,and we can obtain pan, tilt, and roll angles from this quaternion. Note that we regard undeterminable anglesas $0 ^ { \\circ }$ when point detection fails or an image has one or no axes from the VP/ADPs. The supplementary presents details of the rotation estimation.
