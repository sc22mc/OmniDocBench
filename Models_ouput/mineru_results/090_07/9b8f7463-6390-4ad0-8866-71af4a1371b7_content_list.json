The algorithms that provide the best performance are KNN,as already demonstrated in the impedance measurement classification study [40] and MLP,with training accuracy above $94 \\%$ and $98 \\%$ ,respectively,and a decrease of less than $5 \\%$ in test accuracy. Overall,as observed ina previous study [41],the MLPhas beenconsidered to provide the best accuracy and stability,as depicted from the bootstrappingvalidation $F _ { 1 }$ scoresin Fig.s3 (see Supplementarymaterial).Fig.s4 (see Supplementary material) displays the confusion matrix related to the developed MLP classification algorithm.In the training phase,such a discrimination model achieves $100 \\%$ precision for identifying control plants and an average of $9 7 . 6 \\%$ for distinctly identifying early and late stress. The model is able to classify,with high precision, the control plantsalso ina test phase,with a precision above $9 9 \\%$ ,andas expected,the precisiondecreases for the earlyand late stress classification, decreasing to $91 \\%$ and $89 \\%$ ,respectively.

Such tools have the potential to greatly improve the crop efficiency,intermsof time,yield,and qualityof theharvested products,aswell as the profit margins of the producers and the sustainability of the crops,finely tuning the application of nutrients to the specific needs of the plants.

        "text": "This work focuses on the characterization of electrical changes in eight tomato plants under iron starvation carried out through continuous bioimpedance measurements over a period of 38 days.Although alarger sample size could enhance biological diversity capture,this study follows recent trends and considers the technique's early stage of development.In addition, unlike many prior studies,it was conducted in a controlled glasshouse environment, enabling precise environmental monitoring.Froman initial examination,itcan be seenthat through the analysis of the seasonality of impedance measurements, a cyclic pattern can be traced following the circadian cycle of plants. Investigating further, results revealed a noticeable divergence in the trend of impedance magnitude at a magnitude of $1 0 \\mathrm { k H z }$ shortly after the elimination of iron from the nutrient solution applied to the plant,indicating an effect of iron stress on plant bioimpedance.In addition,this work proved how by employing the Cole model extracted parameters as a discriminating feature; it is possible to both monitor the evolution of the plant health status and to identify stress-induced patterns.First, this was proved byan ANOVA analysis,where the extracted circuit parameters resulted to be statistically different,between ironstressed and control plants. Second,based on this assumption, the equivalent circuit components were successfully employed for the training of various classification models to discriminate plants in control,early,and late stress conditions.Here,the MLP algorithm resulted to achieve the best training accuracy $( 9 8 \\% )$ and a precision to classify the early and late stress with a precision of $91 \\%$ and $89 \\%$ ,respectively.
