Body temperature is measured in two ways: skin and core temperature by contact LM35 precision sensor, connected to a high resolution logger and thermal emission in $8 – 1 4 \\mu m$ areaby IRimaging sensor (NEDT $\\leq \\mathrm { \\ f { ~ 6 0 m K } ~ }$ Both methods deliver the same temperature data,but differ significantly in terms of thermal dynamics: IR method requires open-skin regions that quickly cool down,while the contact method is best suited for measuring internal body dynamics.

Stabilized power supply isalso measured by a separate sensor,the delta-sigma ADC with 24 bit sampling is used.In this work we utilize a passive scheme for the calorimeter, where a slow temperature variation is provided by a circadian rhythm in the laboratory (about 1-1.5 $^ \\circ \\mathrm { C }$ for 24 hours) and guaranties a high degree of homogeneity in temperature distribution.Differences caused by changes in the heat capacity of water samples are measured as symmetry breaks between channels,small fluctuations about $1 0 ^ { - 5 } ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ of relative temperature can be detected. This system is used to explore the heat capacity of para-and ortho-isomers of water [25].In several experimentswe use electrochemical impedance spectrometers [3O] to detect effects on environmental sensors, see Fig. 7.
