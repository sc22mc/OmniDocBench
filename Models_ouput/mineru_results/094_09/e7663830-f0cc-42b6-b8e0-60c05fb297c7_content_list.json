This can be time-and resource-consuming in monitoring and collection of data.The detection of leaf disease,as well as the collecting and labeling of a large number of disease photos,requires a hugeamount of people,material resources,and financial resources.Some plant diseases have a shorter onset period and are more difficult to collect [9]. Furthermore,the storage and processing of datasets can be demanding.For instance, the use ofhigh-resolution images and hyperspectral images involves the processing of a large amount of data. This poses some computational challenges.Hence,the need to employ parallel processing,batch processing,and hardware acceleration could solve these computational challenges and provide a real-time analysis asa viable solution.
