The idea of public key cryptography was first mentioned in a confidential report GCHQ [4] (UK Government Communications Headquarters) and later independently by Diffie and Hellman in 1976 [27] along with the first practical public key cryptosystem based on knapsack problem. The mostly known asymmetric cryptosystem (RSAï¼‰ was invented by Rivest,Shamir and Adleman in 1978[17] and is applicable since thento encryption and digital signatures. ",

        "text": "The concept of synchronization of finite automata is essential in various areas of computer science. It consists in regaining control over a system by applying a specific set of input instructions. These instructions lead the system to a fixed state no matter in which state it was at the beginning. The idea of synchronization has been studied for many classes of complete deterministic finite automata (DFA) [1,2,5, 9,10,16,18, 20,23,22,24, 25] and non-deterministic ",
