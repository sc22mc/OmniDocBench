Clients can connect and request changes to almost any element in the world being essential for the creation of scenarios. They also receive sensor data and manage input to the vehicle controlled by the user. CARLA supports a wide range of sensor suites with extensive configurability to its intrinsic parameters. In our work,we use a LiDAR sensor on top of the vehicle and a monocular RGB camera,placed in the front part of the car, for simulated data collection. By placing these sensors in an autonomous car and initiating its navigation in the virtual environment, we were able to create a very large dataset for evaluating our algorithms. In the future,we plan to assess the AR visualization effectiveness,with respect to reaction time and awareness increase,in a real environment witha drivermanually controllinga vehicle. ",
