Common trajectory segmentation policies either requirea priori knowledge of machinery operator behavior and their driving patterns;geo-markers from third party sources; or rely on using established road networks. These concepts and methods do not crossover to an agricultural setting.To the best of the authors’knowledge,challenging conjoined field segmentation cases have not been addressed in thecurrent literature.Acost-effective coordinate-based solution to automatically segment agricultural fields is required.

Then,the proposed algorithm is presented in two stages.In Stage I,measurements are preprocessed to determine whether PTO activation has occurred and ifroad travel has taken place between activation periods,as described in Section II-B. In Stage II, pathways that may be present between adjacent fields in the sampled image are removed by applying a series of morphological image operations. The algorithm then detects the individual field boundaries from the processed image.Finally,the feld boundaries are converted back to Cartesian and the machinery coordinatedata are labeled as belonging toaparticular field,with details given in Section III-C. The method is fully automated, deterministic,and segments all fields in a job site in one pass. ",
