We have addressed an area of unexplored territory by assessing the need for the inclusion of a reaction medium in stellar heavy-ion fusion calculations.The coupled-channelsdensity-matrix method,which is based on the theory of open quantum systems,unambiguously include thermal and atomic effects on subbarrier fusion dynamics. The calculations show that plasma temperature strongly enhances fusion probability. This pioneeringeffort suggests that careful considerations should be made when modeling or performing experiments on collision partners with low-lying excited states at high temperature. Despite no changes in fusion probability due to atomic effects, there is scope to reintroduce these effects when more experiments are completed and new theoretical studies arepublished. ",
