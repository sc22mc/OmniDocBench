The $\\mathrm { C } ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ (2-1) data always appear at a higher velocity than the $\\mathrm { D C O ^ { + } }$ (3-2) spectra.In order to investigate this point further, we show in Fig.8the velocity difference $\\bar { V _ { { \\mathrm { l s r } } } } ( \\mathbf { C } ^ { 1 8 } \\mathbf { O } ) \\bar { \\mathbf { \\Sigma } } - V _ { { \\mathrm { l s r } } } ( \\mathbf { D } \\mathbf { C } \\mathbf { O } ^ { + } )$ with the $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ column density overlaid on top.In addition,we did not find any correlation between the velocity shift and the $\\mathrm { H } _ { 2 }$ column density map.In this figure the shift between $\\mathrm { C } ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ (2- 1) and $\\mathrm { D C O ^ { + } }$ (3-2) is clearly visible.We report a mean velocity shift of $0 . 1 3 \\mathrm { k m s ^ { - 1 } }$ across the whole source.The largest velocity shift values are found on the west side of the protostellar core, where the infalling material from the envelope reaches the core, under the assumption that the small velocity gradient seen along the filament represents an accretion flow.On the southeast and northwest sides of the core there is a very low-velocity shift, equal to $\\sim 0 . 0 6 \\ \\mathrm { k m s ^ { - 1 } }$ and these values are increasing toward the protostar position up to $0 . 1 0 \\mathrm { k m s ^ { - 1 } }$ . To calculate these lowvelocity shifts we use the pixels indicated with a black plus sign in Fig. 8 ",

The velocity shift between a neutral and an ionized species was observed in the past. For instance,Henshaw $\\boxed { \\mathrm { e t ~ a l . } } ( \\boxed { 2 0 1 3 } )$ studied the large-scale velocity field throughout the cloud in $\\overline { { \\mathrm { G 0 3 5 . 3 9 . 0 0 . 3 3 } } }$ ,and found avelocity shiftbetween the two tracers of $\\mathrm { N } _ { 2 } \\mathrm { H } ^ { + } ( 1 \\mathrm { - } 0 )$ and $\\mathrm { C } ^ { 1 8 } \\mathrm { O }$ (1-0),in agreement with a model of collision between filaments that is still ongoing. It follows that the velocity structure of the core does not have intrinsic properties but is a product of large-scale motions on filamentary scales.They proposed that the velocity difference in the cloud occurs because of filament merging,implying that higher velocityfilamentsare interactingwith alower velocity,less massive filament, increasing the density of an intermediate velocity filament $\\scriptstyle ( { \\overline { { \\mathrm { B a r n e s ~ e t ~ a l . } } } } | 2 0 1 8 )$ ",

According to Zhang et al.2017 velocity shifts between high-density and low-density tracers within a cloud are indicative of gas expanding and contracting.It is based on the assumption that the higher critical density molecules trace the dense gas closer to the inner of a core,while lower critical density molecules trace the more extended gas in the outer envelope. Magnetic braking might have had a great impact in this cloud. We determined that the rotation axis of the core and magnetic field lines are almost aligned.According to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse models,magnetic braking should be effective in this cloud,which is in agreement with theabsence ofaresolvedKeplerian disk.Magnetic braking isan effective way to remove angular momentum from infalling and rotating material, suppressing envelope fragmentation and the formation of large disks.
