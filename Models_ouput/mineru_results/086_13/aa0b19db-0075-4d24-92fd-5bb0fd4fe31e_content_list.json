SAM is an algorithm that classifes hyperspectral imagery based on the angle between the spectra. Based on the spectral angle difference, pixels are classified into categories such as healthy or diseased plants [268].Maximum likelihood classification is a probabilistic classifier that assigns apixel to the class that has the maximum likelihood. It can be used for plant disease detection to classfy hyperspectral data into categories like healthy or diseased [269]. On the other hand, PLSR is a statistical technique that can model the relationship between hyperspectral data and plant disease severity [270]. Dirichlet aggregation regression uses Dirichlet distributions for modeling compositional data,and it can also be used to model therelationship between hyperspectral data and plant disease severity [271].Logistic regression is used forcases with binary classification,such as disease or no disease detection [272], whereas multiple linear regression can provide multiple classes classification[273].

        "text": "The machine-learning-based classification models can be broadly categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Supervised learning techniques require labeled training images/samples to detect the pixel of the region of interest (ROI).A label isassociated with each ROI to map the class categories.The labeling of the images is visually conducted and sent to the classification model for training. This aids in improving the detection accuracy of the models but at the expense of high labor costs.On the other hand,unsupervised learning techniques require no prior knowledge and learning through clusteringand distribution rules of the spectral features in the images.An example of unsupervised learning would be the K-means clusteringalgorithm.Rice sheath blight diseases were detected using the K-means clustering algorithm in [274]. A study by Yuan et al. [275] proposed an unsupervised learning technique to identify anthracnose diseases in tea leaves.The studycould achieve around $96 \\%$ ofaccuracies fordisease detection[274].
