Section II provides an overview of the common pests and diseases affecting ginger plants.Section IV presents the various methods of pest disease management under two categories:conventional methods and smart and precision methods. In Section V,the molecular methods and image processing techniques for pests and disease detection of ginger plants are presented.The use of AIoT for pests and disease management is discussed in Section VI. Section VII discusses the challenges in the adoption of AIoT and Section VIII points out the future directions.Finally, Section IX concludes this article. ",

The authors in[17] and [35] provided a review of various deep learning (DL）architectures and machine learning (ML） techniques for disease classification and detection in various plants.However, the review provided a limited discussion on disease detection and classification in ginger plants.The different imaging techniques for plant diseases were presented in [1O].While the different techniques for early detection and classification of different kinds of disease were discussed,it did not include the ginger plant.Ngugi et al. [37] provided a review of image processing techniques based on visible images for pest and disease recognition in infected plants. The image processing techniques were discussed under three categories:handcrafted,DL,and ahybrid combination of handcrafted and DL techniques.The handcrafted involves basic processes,such as image capture, preprocessing,segmentation, feature extraction,and classification using ML techniques.The DL technique involves the use of DLarchitectures,such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet,visual graphics group-16 (VGG-16),and several others,while the hybrid involves the combination of handcrafted feature extraction and DL techniques.A review of imaging techniques for several plants was presented but did not include the ginger plant. On the other hand,Yadav et al. [36] focused on ginger but the review was limited to soft rot (rhizome rot） disease and the use of various techniques,such as chemical, biological,and nanotechnology to manage the disease in ginger. The review did consider AI or IoT for the detection and classification of diseases in ginger plants.Similarly,the authorsin [31], [32], [33],and [34] have provided a review of diseases related to the ginger plant. For instance,Meenu et al. [32],[33] highlighted the symptoms, causative agents,epidemiology,and protection from these diseases affecting ginger plants as well as disease management. While these works have identified the various diseases affecting the ginger plant,there is still a need for a comprehensive review of works on diseases,management,and the use of the latest technologies,such as IoT,AI,and AIoT for disease detection in ginger plants.

        "text": "1）Rhizome Rot: Rhizome rot also known as soft rot is a serious disease affecting ginger production and can affect the plant at any developmental stage [36]. The disease is predisposed to water-logged conditions and is caused by several species of Pythium [38]. Soft rot initially manifestsas wet,brown blisters above the ground sections at the rhizome-stem junction,better known as collars. The blisters/lesions gradually grow larger and coalesce resulting in rot and collapsing of the collar regions.Foliar symptoms appear as yellowing of the tips of lower leaves, which gradually spreads to the leaf blades [36].The yellowing can progress to allthe leaves moving in an upward direction eventually resulting in drooping and withering of the pseudostem. The leaf symptoms could be easily confused with those of withering from $R$ solanacearum or Fusarium yellows [36].However, experienced scouts could easily distinguish this. ",

Infected plants exhibit leaf yellowing,wilting,and a rotten rhizome. Infected plant also produces shriveled tubers and sometimes brown ground tissue.Some of the symptoms appear to overlapwith soft rot;however,experienced pathologists can distinguish this by symptom visualization.

The incidence of the disease is higher,and the yield of the rhizome isreduced when the ginger is cultivated continuously without the rotation of the crop [33], [40].Symptoms include round,oval to elongated spots on the leaves,which are white at the center, thin and papery,and more often torn up.Sometimes pycnidia (black) can be observed at the center of the spots.As the disease progress,infected areas dry and fall outresulting in shotholes.Fig.1(c) shows infected ginger leaf spot disease.
