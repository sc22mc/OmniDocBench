Since the present calculations only include excited states of the $^ \\mathrm { 1 8 8 }$ Os ground-state rotational band, the spin degeneracy factors in Eq. (4) will be irrelevant. Excited states are thermally populated before the target and projectile interact with each otherand thermodynamic equilibrium isassumed at the start of the reaction [19,20]. As known from coupled channels calculations,coupling of the radial motion to energy eigenstates can cause changes in fusion probability.Population of excited states in either the target or projectile nucleus due to surface vibrations or rotational excited states lead to an overall increase in fusion probability due to coherent coupled channels effects [21].For the dynamical calculations,we use the same equation of motion for the density matrix of the reduced system as the one used in Ref. [18],Eq. (5). This method uses the Lindblad master equation,allowing coupling between the radial and energy eigenstate bases,and uses Lindblad operators to introduce novel effects into the calculation. Anenergy projection technique is used to calculate the fusion probability for specific collision energies [18]. ",
