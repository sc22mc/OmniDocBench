The accuracy of the disease classification reached $93 \\%$ [306]. Another popular statistical algorithm PCA is sometimes also used for disease classification.One such study can be found in[307],where the labeled image of cucumber leaves with downy mildew disease isused to perform the analysis.PCA is used to reduce the complexity of the hyperspectral images. This study only used 2O leaves (ten infected and ten healthy) to train and obtained $90 \\%$ detection accuracy [307]. However, this analysis might not be very suitable as the training with fewer hyperspectral images could result in biased results. ",

[170] compared twoclassification techniques,namely radial basis function (RBF) and kNN,to detect citrus canker diseases in citrus plants. The experiment was conducted using images fromdifferent disease development stages of plants using UAVs.Around 31 vegetation indices were included to be detectedusing theRBFandkNNalgorithms.The resultsshow that RBF could detect the citrus canker better than kNN. Also,among all the vegetation indices,only the photochemical reflectance index and the water index were accurately detected [170]. QDA analysis is one of the most popular techniques,which estimatesa covariance matrix and correlates each class.QDA was employed to study avocado plants’Laurel wilt disease (fungal). The hyperspectral images were collected from the glasshouse and field, which resulted in an accuracy of $94 \\%$ [308]. A study on celery cropswas conducted by Huang and Apan [213] to detect the Sclerotinia rot diseases.The author employed PLSR algorithms to perform the disease classification,resulting in an accuracy of $8 8 . 9 2 \\%$ .Acombination of FDA with Savitzky-Golay was performed toclassify theyellow rust diseases inwheat.Theclassification accuracy reached $92 \\%$ [7],[309], showing a promising statistical technique.

Overfitting of a modelis defined as the instances when the model is trained with a large number of data,and instead of focusing on the essential features,it focuses on the noise.Thus,the correct classification of the data is not achieved due to the extensive information and noise.In short, the model obtains low bias and high variance values.On the other hand,underfitting of a model isdefined as the instanceswhen the model cannot learn the underlying information or trend in the dataset.This occurs due to high bias and low variance value and also due to the insufficient number of data. Sometimes,the underfitting may happen when nonlinear data are used to develop a linear model [3oo]. Hence, basedon the quality of the dataset,aclassificationalgorithm should be chosen. ",

A study was conducted by Muhammed [310] to evaluate the fungal disease severity in wheat leaves.The crop reflectance data and complementary diseased leaf vectors are first normalized through bandwise and spectralwise normalization techniques. Then,kNNalgorithms are applied to classify the types of wheat diseases.After the classification step,the images are fed to a linear transformation model so that the correlation factor can beobtained to define the severity rank of the diseases [310]. Spectral assessment and interpretation are also used to determine the disease severity assessment index.One such study was found in [296],where the disease severity of powderymildew in wheat plants was estimated.A spectroradiometer evaluated the hyperspectral reflectance of the healthy and infected leaves in a laboratory setting.Nine ranks of disease severity scales were defined by using the disease index.Multivariate linear regression (MLR) and PLSR assessed the disease severity. Once the models were run and validation of the model was completed, the images were evaluated through the relative root-mean-square error(RMSE)metric.Results show that the PLSR model had lowerrelative RMSE and a higher coefficient of determination score than MLR models [296].
