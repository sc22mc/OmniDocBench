While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios,GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks,including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around thetop $10 \\%$ oftest takers.GPT-4 is a Transformerbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior.A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales.This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,0ooth the compute of GPT-4.
