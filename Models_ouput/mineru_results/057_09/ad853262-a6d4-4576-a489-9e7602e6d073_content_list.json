Each participant was then asked to reproduce the same set of 10 randomly selected bug recordings from real-world issue reports in GitHub,on average,3.6 TAP, 1.2SCROLL,and 1.0 INPUT per recording. The experimental bug recordings can be seen in our online appendixThe study involved two groups of four participants: the control group $P _ { 1 }$ ， $P _ { 2 }$ ， $P _ { 3 }$ ， $P _ { 4 }$ who gets help with the reproduction steps written by reporters from GitHub,and the experimental group $P _ { 5 }$ $P _ { 6 }$ ， $P _ { 7 }$ ， $P _ { 8 }$ who gets help with the natural language description generated by our tool. Each pair of participants $\\langle P _ { x } , P _ { x + 4 } \\rangle$ has comparable development experience,so the experimental group has similar capability to the control group in total. Note that we did not ask participants to finish half of the tasks with our tool while the other half without assisting tool to avoid potential tool bias.We recorded the time used to reproduce the bug recordings in Android. Participants had up to 10 minutes for each bug replay. To minimize the impact of stress,we gave a few minutes break between each bug replay. At the end of the tasks,we provided 5-point Likert-scale questions to collect their feedback,in terms of clearness,conciseness, and usefulness.We further collected participants’feedback through a few open-ended questions, which can help us bring more insight into our tool, including how could the subtitles be improved,are there any software engineering tasks that would benefit from subtitles, etc. ",
