        "text": "The NDW was initially predicted to be neutron rich,and Woosley et al.(1994) found it underwent a strong r-process that closely matched the solar r-process abundance pattern,in large part due to the high entropies found in their calculations.Subsequent work (e.g. Witt et al. 1994; Qian & Woosley 1996; Otsuki et al. 2000; Thompson et al. 2oo1) failed to reproduce conditions suitable for a strong r-process, finding entropies significantly lower than Woosley etal.(1994).Laterwork hasexplored the impactof otherpossible physics on theNDW,but has generally shown that,outside of extreme conditions-high PNS mass,unrealistically low electron fractions,or magnetar-strength magnetic fields-a wind heated purely by neutrinos does not reach high enough entropies or short enough dynamical timescales during seed formation to allow for a strong r-process (e.g. Thompson et al. 2001; Metzger et al. 2007; Wanajo 2013). The inclusion of corrections from general relativity tends to make conditions morefavorable for the r-process,butavery highPNSmassis still required for a strong r-process to proceed (Cardall & Fuller 1997; Otsuki et al. 2000; Thompson et al.2001).A number of studies have explored the effects of rotation and magnetic fields in varying dimensionality (Metzger et al. 2007; Vlasov et al. 2014; Thompson & ud Doula 2018; Desai et al.2022), further confirming that extreme conditions - high PNS masses and magnetar-strength magnetic fields - are required for conditions to favor an r-process.

Simulations by Fischer etal. (2O1O) and Hudepohl etal.(2010) found that the neutrino spectrum from the PNS was likely to result in a proton-rich wind,precluding an r-process altogether. Subsequent work by Roberts et al. (2012) and MartinezPinedo et al. (2O12） found slightly neutron-rich conditions when nuclear mean field effects were included.Later studies from Pllumbi et al.(2015) and Xiong et al. (2019) included neutrino oscillation effects,again finding that only proton-rich or slightly neutron-rich conditions were likely to occurin the wind.In short,it seems unlikely that the generally low seed-formation entropy can be compensated byan increased neutron fraction.

        "text": "Rather,the most promising avenue for a strong r-process in the NDWis to invokea secondary heating effect that takesplace in the seed-forming region of the wind (Qian & Woosley 1996). Suzuki & Nagataki (20o5) proposed damped Alfven waves as a source for this heating,finding that waves generated by magnetar-strength magnetic fields could deposit sufficient energy in this region to predict a strong r-process. Metzger et al. (2007) also suggested that a small amount of additional heating from acoustic waves,deposited in the seedforming region,could drive a strong r-process independent of magnetorotational effects.More recently, Gossan et al. (202O) suggested that gravito-acoustic waves generated by PNS convection could have an important effect on the dynamics of the NDW.Most recently, supernova simulations by Nagakura et al. (2O2O) and Nagakura et al. (2021） indicate that such convection is a common and significant feature across a broad range of progenitors,so convection-driven effects in the wind are likely to be important in most supernovae. Theyfind that PNS convection is strongest in the first 1-2 seconds post-bounce,then gradually subsides. Gravito-acoustic wave heating istherefore likelyto operateinthe early stages of theNDW,when it is most likely to be neutron rich (e.g.Roberts etal.2012). These effects are powered by the gravitational contraction of the PNS,which provides an energy reservoir of some $1 0 ^ { 5 3 }$ erg during contraction and deleptonization (Gossan et al.2O2O).Even a small fraction of this binding energy coupling to the wind via wave emission could have a significantimpact.

They canalso shock,efficiently depositing their energy into the wind and actingasa secondary heat source.Our objective in this paperis to determine the conditions in which a strong r-process can take place when the effects of these waves are included.To this end,we assume a spherically symmetricand slightly neutron-rich wind and investigate the impact of varying the energy contained in the waves reaching the wind region,aswell asthe frequency of the waves,which impacts theradius of shock formation and their subsequent rate of energy deposition.
