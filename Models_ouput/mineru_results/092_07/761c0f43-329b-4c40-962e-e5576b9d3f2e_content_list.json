If a PMFC cannot supply $P _ { \\mathrm { P M F C } } \\geq P _ { \\mathrm { I N , M I N } }$ ,cold start is not overcome,and the storage element cannot be charged. $P _ { \\mathrm { I N , M I N } }$ largely depends on capacitor self-discharge current,which increases with rated capacitance, and on loads connected to the dc/dc output during cold start. To ensure both cold start overcoming and node energetic autonomy, we find the largest capacitor $C _ { \\mathrm { M A X } }$ we can charge with the maximum $P _ { \\mathrm { P M F C } }$ we can extract,using low-leakage capacitor technology. The tested capacitors are reported in Table I.We also remove all unnecessary loads from the dc/dc output during cold start,as explained in Section II1-C2. $C _ { \\mathrm { M A X } }$ poses a limit to the maximum energy we can draw during an uninterruptible task,which is something to keep in mind during system design.

We charged an example $4 7 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { F }$ capacitor ( $C _ { 2 }$ ,TableI)and considered the fastest charging method to be most efficient at setting the actual MPP.Fig.4-right confirms that the proposed external OCV sampling method ensures much faster charging when the main boost is active and actively polarizing the PMFC at its set-point MPP.
