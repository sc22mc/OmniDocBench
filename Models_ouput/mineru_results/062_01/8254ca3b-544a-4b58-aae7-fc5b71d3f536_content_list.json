Nevertheless, unanticipated events such as the existence of unexpected objects in therange of the road,can put safetyat risk.The advancement of sensing and communication technologies and Internet of Thingsmay facilitate the recognition of hazardous situations and information exchange in a cooperative driving scheme, providing new opportunities for the increase of collaborative situational awareness.Safe and unobtrusive visualization of the obtained information may nowadays be enabled through the adoption ofnovel Augmented Reality (AR)interfaces in the form of windshields.Motivated by these technological opportunities,we propose in this work a saliency-based distributed,cooperative obstacle detection and rendering scheme for increasing the driver'ssituational awareness through (i) automated obstacle detection,(ii) AR visualization and (ii) information sharing (upcoming potential dangers）with other connected vehicles or road infrastructure.An extensive evaluation study using a variety ofreal datasets for pothole detection showed that the proposed method provides favorable results and features compared to other recent and relevant approaches.

Enhancing situational awareness isespecially critical in the case of semi-autonomous cars, where the operator may be distracted by secondary activities, e.g.looking at the phone or reading a book.If the driver has to take over control,it is important to minimize the required reaction time.This can be achieved by monitoring and presenting to the driver the crucial information about the environment, thus keeping him/her aware of potentially hazardous situations.Inherent challenges include the need for unobtrusive information display，avoiding the effects of tunnel vision which could lead to actually overlooking critical information $\\pmb { \\mathbb { H } }$ ",

Although image-based techniques have achieved great success,one common drawback is that they are sensitive to motion blur and changes in lighting and/or even shadows [10]. Also, most techniques do not account for other passing vehicles [11]. This can make them unreliable in real use cases, which is a major weakness in problems involving human safety.In light of all this,the use of a 3D LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging） sensor could provide more robust sensing capabilities for the analysis of potholes,in the same way that it is used to increase the accuracy of road's boundary detection [12], [13], [14]. On the other hand,a limitation of the LiDAR sensor is that, due to refraction and reflection,water appearsasablackholein theimagerycalculated fromLiDAR data [15l, imposing additional challenges in the detection of potholes filled with water.

To address the above issues，we developed a point cloud processing system that takes as input road environment data and classifies them into safe and potentially hazardous regions byidentifying obstacles lying in the range of the road.We selected LiDAR as sensing modality for the surrounding environment due to its ability to retrieve depth information and its large range,making it suitable for driving environments.For more robust estimation,LiDAR data are fused with information on driving patterns,such as the steering angle of the wheels. For implementation and evaluation,we utilized the open-source CARLA simulator $\\lVert \\overline { { 1 6 } } \\rVert$ including also a multi-agent system of vehicles,and we augmented it with our obstacle detection and tracking component.In this simulated environment,information sharing between agents is enabled, so that vehicles are notified about incoming obstacles even when there is no direct line-of-sight.
