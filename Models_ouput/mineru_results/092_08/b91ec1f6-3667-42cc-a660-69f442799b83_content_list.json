Throughout these three days,we collected measurements from a power-producing (i.e., active) and nonpower-producing (i.e.,inactive） cell to identify similarities and differences between their impedance spectra.The EIS measurementswere obtained at OCV with an Autolab PGSTAT302N,alaboratory-graded potentiostat used as a reference.This instrument automatically measures OCV and triggers ameasurement sweepwhenever OCVis sufficiently stable.EIS measurements were executed with a setup matching the twoelectrode configuration of the MAX30134 upon deployment (see Section II-C). The spanned frequency range starts at $0 . 0 1 4 \\ : \\mathrm { H z }$ and ends at $2 7 \\mathrm { k H z }$ ,tomatch the full range of the MAX30134 IC.Results of the EIS measurements done with the reference potentiostat can be seen in Fig. 6.

The phase is shifted to the left as time progresses. Also,alive PMFC shows a higher phase at lower frequencies thaninactive PMFC.Overall, time variations across the three daysand differences between the active and inactive cells are appreciable. ",
