All the light rays coming into the camera can be parameterized by $( x , y , u , v )$ ，where $( u , v )$ and $( x , y )$ denote the positions on the aperture and imaging planes,respectively. Therefore,a light field $L$ is defined over $( x , y , u , v )$ . We assume that each light ray has only a monochrome intensity; but the extension to RGB color is straight-forward in theory.We also assume that $x , y , u , v$ take discretized integer values; thus, $L$ is equivalent to a set of multi-view images, where $( x , y )$ and $( u , v )$ respectively denote the pixel position and viewpoint. The arrangement of the viewpoints is assumed to be $8 \\times 8 ( u , v \\in \\{ 1 , \\ldots , 8 \\} )$ .Each element of $L$ is described using subscripts as $L _ { x , y , u , v }$ .The goal of our method is to reconstruct $L$ of the target scene from the data measured on the camera in a single exposure.
