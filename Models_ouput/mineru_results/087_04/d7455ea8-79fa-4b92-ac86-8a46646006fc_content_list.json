Policies may be based on speed,direction,start-end, stop-move, time intervals,and predefined geo-fenced regions to segment trajectories.Such policy concepts do not crossover to agricultural applications.Start-end locations may notbe known a priori. Stop-move locations depend on assumptions about operator driving behavior and machine operation.In baling, for example, the operator must stop the vehicle to drop the formed balesand replace the bale net.

These methods rely on correlating trajectories to road network databases by usinga similarity score,as defined by the author. This could be useful for cases of agricultural machinery traveling on roads between fields,however,not for cases of adjacent fields connected by short,off-road pathways ashighlighted in Fig.2(a). Moreira and Santos [45] devised anapproach to obtain the convex or concave hull perimeter of agiven set of points usinga k-nearest neighbours approach. In a concave shape,a straight line can be drawn between two points within the shape, that goes out of bounds.The set of conjoined fields shown in Fig.2(a) delineatea concave shape. When applying the algorithm presented in [45],users must tunethe $k$ parameter to adapt the shape of polygons output by thealgorithm.Adapting the algorithm presented for conjoined field segmentation may require manual intervention to adjust parameters per job site to account for unique shapes,sizes,and numbersoffields.

The inverse is true when the PTO is inactive and the implement is in motion,which allows for the detection of road travel.
