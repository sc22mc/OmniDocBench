The non-parametric Chi-square and MannWhitney U tests are used for statistical analysis against two different null-hypotheses,see also [38].For Chi-square test the positive/negative results in experimental attempts are represented by $\\cdot _ { 1 } \\cdot _ { / \\cdot 0 } ,$ and we consider the null hypothesis about arandom character of obtained data ( $50 \\%$ of success under the experimental channel).The Mann-Whitney U test analyzes two groups of reactions from experimental and control attempts, where the null hypothesis is an identical distribution function of these groups.Results are shown in Table I; based on obtained values we reject the null hypotheses for Chi-square and MannWhitney U tests (significance level $\\alpha = 0 . 0 0 5$ ,two tailed).

Experiments with external calorimetric measurements clearly demonstrate the same long-term sustained temperature variations where somatic factors are fully excluded. ",

        "text": "Publications with spin isomers of water suggest that temperature variations in aqueous solutions can be explained by different heat capacity of para-and ortho-isomers [25]. The spin conversion changes the equilibrium 3:1 rate of spin isomers and thus changes the heat capacity.This in turn results in asymmetry breaking dynamics of temperature in differential calorimeters.The spin conversion can be triggered by different weak interactions (with minimal energy about $1 0 ^ { - 2 7 } \\mathrm { J }$ ，e.g. bylong-range spin-spin interactions [39],[40] or environmental factors [41]. Taking into account recent publications on non-classical brain functions,in particular on entanglementmediated consciousness [28],as ahypothesis,it is assumed that such a spin conversion induced through ASC,can cause the observed thermal effects.

Natural materials (e.g.,molecules) are capable ofperforming certain calculations at the molecular or spin levels,which is studied in natural computing [51]-[53]. Due to long-range spin-spin interactions [39], [4O], internal and external thermal phenomena can be considered as manifestations of one common process.
