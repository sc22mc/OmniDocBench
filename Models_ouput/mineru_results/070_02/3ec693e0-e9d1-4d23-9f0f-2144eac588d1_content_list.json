Whereas for QL termination,angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES） measurements on MBT $^ { 1 }$ andMBT $^ 2$ yield similar results to (Bi,Sb) $^ 2$ Teg，without a discernible DP, there is a DP within the bulk gap for the SL termination [19].Also,the topmost sheet of the ferromagnetically arranged Mn momentsshould strongly couple with the topological surface states (TSS)，albeit a thorough spectroscopic investigation of the surface magnetism is still pending. As a result,a much higher $T _ { \\mathrm { Q A H } } ~ { = } ~ 1 . 4 \\mathrm { K }$ isachieved in MnBi $^ { 2 }$ Te $^ 4$ [20].Thisis despite the fact that MnBi $^ 2$ Te $^ 4$ is suboptimal due to itsantiferromagnetic （AFM） order( $T _ { \\mathrm { N } } = 2 4 \\mathrm { K }$ ）anda complex layer-number dependence of the quantization effects,with an odd number of SLs required to realize the QAHE [20].

This experimental realization of a QAHE device out of a bulk crystal required technically challenging but feasible efforts to attain the charge neutrality condition [29].
