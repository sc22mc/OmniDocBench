Fig.1(a) and (b)) shows some of the infected ginger leaf and rhizome.   \n2）Bacterial Soft Rot:The bacteria soft rot is caused by Erwiniachrysanthemi and itis aidedby high temperatures and saturated soils.A gradual softening of the rhizome tissue occurswith offensive odor.

Some of the identified pests affecting ginger are rhizome scale,shoot borer, root-knot nematodes, leafroller,white grub,and rhizome fly [46],[47], [48]. The rhizome scale is a small,round,and brownish insect that feeds on the sap of ginger rhizomes.Affected plants show stunted growth,yellowing of leaves,and reduced vigor. The shoot borer is a moth whose larvae bore into the ginger shoots,causing significant damage. Affected plants show holes in the stems, and the central shoot often collapses.The root-knot nematodes aremicroscopic worms that infest the roots of ginger plants. Infested plants exhibit stunted growth,yellowing of leaves,and formation of characteristic galls on the roots.The leaf roller isa caterpillar that feeds on ginger leaves,causing them to roll up and form protective shelters.The caterpillars roll the leaves longitudinally and feed inside the rolled leaves,leading to reduced photosynthetic area and poor plant growth.Affected leaves show feeding damage and may become dry and brittle.

Moreover, they create entry wounds,which facilitate easier entry for these pathogens. TableI provides a summary of the ginger diseasesand pests. ",
