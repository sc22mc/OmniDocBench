Field boundariesmay also be used to monitor in-field application rates of additive materials recorded frommachinery [2O].Thisisrelevant ata timewhen theEU aims to halve pesticideuse by 2030 under the farm-tofork strategy [21]. Proximal sensing applications on agricultural machinery [14],[22],[23] may playa role in satisfyingPA data requirements [5],but the data must first be spatially classified. The required resolution is application dependent, however, isolating machinery data to inside a field geometric boundary is an essential step prior to processing agricultural machinery data. ",

However, the complexity will increase for field-to-field cases, i.e.,machinery moves between adjacent fields that share a common boundary. Manual methods may be used for difficult segmentation cases, incurring a significant labor and time cost.However, to make data analysis of agricultural machinery practical for industrial scale application,agricultural machinery trajectory segmentation must be automated [6].
