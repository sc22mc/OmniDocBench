This article examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to address these limitations and transform ginger cultivation.It provides a comprehensive analysis ofconventional pest and disease managementstrategies,identifying their shortcomingsand exploringthe potential of emergingAI technologies, including the AIof things'applications,for accurate,efficient,and timely detection and control.By pinpointing the challenges and outlining promising avenuesfor future research,this studyaimsto equipagriculturists and researchers with the knowledge necessary to optimize ginger production,enhance food security,and foster sustainable farming practices.

The leading producers of ginger include India,China,Idonesia,igeria,Thiland,Jmica,angladeh, Nepal, Cameron,and Japan [3],[4].Despite its economic significance,ginger production faces numerous challenges,with diseases posinga substantial threat to yield and quality. These diseases,caused by fungi,bacteria,viruses,and nematodes,can significantly reduce yield and quality. ",

        "text": "In August 2O23,a devastating fungal epidemic ravaged ginger crops in Kaduna State,Nigeria, wiping out approximately $9 5 \\%$ of the region's production.The disease,characterized by sudden yellowingand drying of leaves,ultimately led to the rotting of ginger rhizomes in the soil[5]. An assessment conducted by the Institute of Agricultural Research,Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria,identified the disease as a fungal infection,which is both air and soilborne.Similar disease outbreaks have been reported in other ginger-producing countries,including bacterial wiltinKochi Prefecture,Japan [6],Ethiopia [7],Queensland, Australia[8],and China[8].Early detection and prediction could have prevented this immense economic loss.These incidents highlight the global nature of ginger diseases and underscore the urgent need for effective disease management strategies to protect ginger crops worldwide.Unfortunately, traditional human-based methods for visually monitoring ginger plants can be ineficient due to factors,such as weather conditions, workload,fatigue,and human error [9],[1O].Furthermore, the use of human experts can be costly for small farmers, time-consuming,and a very tedious task [1O].Hence,the use of artificial intelligence (AI),the Internet of Things (IoT), and the use of artificial intelligence of things(AIoT） tools forplant disease detection have become an active research area.
