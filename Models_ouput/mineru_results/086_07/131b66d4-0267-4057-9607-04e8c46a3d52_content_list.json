CASI and HyMap imagesare used to calculate chlorophyll content [7O], crop yield [71],detecting plant stress [72],and biochemical properties [73]. The disadvantage of airplane-based hyperspectral imaging is that the scheduling and flight operation are expensive. The airplanes should flyat $1 { - } 2 0 \\mathrm { k m }$ to capture medium-to-high spatial resolution of the targets.In addition,the airplanes need to be very steady and stable so that the images are captured and the required resolution is obtained [42], [74],[75]. Some studies show that manned helicopters are used as a platform for hyperspectral imagingas the flight missionis more flexible than airplane-based ones.However, financial constraints for image acquisition with helicopters remain challenging to solve [42], [76].

The spatial resolution of HJ-1A is $1 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ ,and the spectral resolution is $5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ [79].

The literature shows that satellite-based hyperspectral image sensors perform satisfactorily foragriculturebased studies.However,the images'data quality and spatial and temporal resolution can affect disease detection in plants [94], [95]. The satellite-based images are also unsuitable for analysis of early pest infestation or disease detection due to their narrow spatial resolution range. The spatial resolution ranges from 17 to $3 6 ~ \\mathrm { m }$ ，which is insufficient for detecting minute details of plants forearly diagnosisof the diseases.Therefore,this limits the application in precision agriculture [42], [96].

These methods can provide accurate information about the pathogens causing the diseases [101]. On the contrary, the indirect method detects plant diseases through many other indirect parameters such as a change in transpirationrate,changein temperature,morphological change, or organic components released by the diseased plants [101]. Indirect methods include biomarker-based detection techniques, such as gaseous metabolite profiling，plant metabolite profiling,and plant-property-based disease detection techniques, including both imaging and spectroscopic techniques [100]. Among the imaging techniques,hyperspectral imaging is an emerging technique,as it can capture the spectral profile of plants,which presents the changes in plants’morphological and physiological characteristics.Consequently,hyperspectral imagingiscategorized under indirectmethodsasit identifies the potential symptoms in plants rather than directly identifying the pathogens causing the disease.Hence,this article primarily addresses hyperspectral imaging techniques for plant disease detection,and other methods of plant disease detection are not reviewed.
