Because there is a misalignment between the hot accretion flow and the accretion disk, the reflection fraction changes with the hot accretion flow precession. The variation of the reflection fraction with LFQPO phases strongly depends on the inclination angle and the truncated disk radius (You et al. 2020). ",

The Keplerian diskis situated outside the shock location and should be very far away from the central black hole (hundreds of $r _ { \\mathrm { g } }$ ）in order tomatch the observed LFQPO frequency(Debnath et al.2014). It would be very difficult to produce a strong disk reflection component and the potential oscillation of the Compton cloud further out in such a scenario. ",

Our results are rather consistent with such an idea that the Compton emission from the jet or jet base illuminates the accretion disk and produces the reflection component (e.g. Dauser et al. 2013; Kara et al. 2016). Other proposals which attribute the broadband X-ray LFQPOs as due to processing jet alone (Ma et al. 2020; Ferreira et al. 2022) is not supported by our spectral analysis,asareflection component with strong effect of reflection fraction isrequired.

Our investigation implies that the original timing signalsor beats that are responsible for theLFQPOs lie in the Compton emission component,and the energy-dependent behavior of theLFQPOsat softer energies $( \\lesssim 3 0 \\mathrm { k e V } )$ is the result of the reflection component with a rather large reflection fraction.If the LFQPOs are due to Lense-Thirring precession,the phase information of precession then lies in the Compton component rather than in the reflection component.
