        "text": "Abstract-Thisarticle presentsa comprehensive examination of the development of a non-contact measuring technique for determining fruit quality. Capacitance measurements were performed onsoap (reference),banana,and nectarine samples acrossa frequency range of $\\mathbf { 5 \\ H z { - } } 2 \\mathbf { 0 0 \\ k H z }$ forbanana and soap,and $\\mathbf { 1 0 H z { - } 1 }$ MHz for nectarine.The data analysis revealed consistent trends in series capacitance $( C _ { s } )$ ,indicatingits suitability for future investigation.Additionally, temperature compensation improved data accuracy.Compensated capacitance data,obtained through linear fitting coeffcients from the first18 hours of data,showed distinct trends inbanana samples,withareduction of $6 . 7 6 \\%$ on the first dayand anadditional $3 . 3 8 \\%$ on the last day,illustrating the impact of aging.In contrast, the soap reference sample exhibited constant capacitance behavior over time.The response of the system to the presence and absence of the fruit sample and the effect of mass loss of the banana fruit on the Cs trends were also examined. Thesystem'scapacity to differentiate between undamaged and damaged sampleswasdemonstrated after the investigation wasexpanded to include 51 nectarines.Following the impact damage, $C _ { s }$ significantly increased,particularly one hour later,aligningwith biochemical changes associated with mechanical damage.ANOVA, atypeof multivariate analysis,highlighted the system's efficacy. Thesystem demonstrated preserved damage detection even 24 hoursafter impact,despite temperature variations.This study provides valuable insights into non-contact measurement methods for potential industrial use,considering the effect of temperature and sample-specific analysis in the accurate evaluation of fruit quality.

Fruit sorting methods taking into consideration both internal and external qualities and flaws are essential throughout all postharvesting stages.In this context, significant challenges arise from mishandling，freezing，and transportation-related damages [2],[3]. To address this, the industry employs sorting techniques to identify unsuitable fruits for market or storage. To date,accurate determination of fruit quality is based on both destructive and nondestructive methods.While destructive methods typically require long times and are not appropriate for large-scale measurements, nondestructive procedures provide instantaneous outcomes and are more desirable.

Such impedance measurement techniques can be classified as contact and noncontact.Extensive research has been conducted on non-destructive contact methods for fruits,such as bananas [7], apples [8],[9],strawberries [10],and mangoes [11].However, with the increasing demand for real-time fruit quality detection in industrial settings,the development of fast,nondestructive, and noncontact detection systems has become crucial [12].
