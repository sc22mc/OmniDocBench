        "text": "$( \\bar { 2 } )$ can be viewed as a rough proxy for the remaining two integrals,when the integrand in both terms is replaced by the arithmetic average of start and end value.In contrast, the integral expressions in formula $\\underline { { \\left. 3 \\right. } }$ take into account the whole path trajectories of $A$ and $\\chi$ on the interval $( t , T ]$ ,and may thus be considered closer to reality. If one is not willing to assume that $A$ and $\\chi$ areindependent,which is obviously an assumption that strongly depends on the considered asset $A$ in concern,an FX decomposition becomes more difficult. For instance,if we assume that there is a positive probability that $A$ and $\\chi$ have common jumps and we observe such jump at $u \\in ( t , T ]$ ，the expression $[ A , \\chi ] _ { t }$ contains $\\Delta A _ { u } \\Delta \\chi _ { u }$ .Which percentage of this expression should be attributed to the PnL induced by FX rate changes,and which to a change in the asset value? While this consideration based on the stochastic integral formula $( 3 )$ might appear quite academic and difficult to implement in practice,it makes very clear in what sense our definition ",

        "text": "We assume that the price $A _ { t }$ isa function of three variables: (i) time $t$ , (ii) a discounting curve $r _ { t }$ , (iii) additional market risk factors $x _ { t }$ . This means we have $A _ { t } = A _ { t } ( r _ { t } , x _ { t } )$ .The additional market risk factors $x _ { t }$ depend on the specific asset and applied pricing model. Forinstance,in case of a bond or credit default swap $x _ { t }$ might bea tuple consisting of a credit spread curve, a recovery rate assumption,and a liquidity spread (e.g. such as the negative basis as introduced in $\\boxed { \\mathrm { M a i } \\ ( 2 0 1 9 ) }$ ).The sub-index $t$ at the interest rate object $r = r _ { t }$ and the market factor $x = x _ { t }$ indicates that the statesof these input variables depend on the time point. If we write $A _ { s } ( \\boldsymbol { r } _ { t } , \\boldsymbol { x } _ { u } )$ we price the asset at time $s$ with the discounting curve from time $t$ and the market factor variablesat time $v$ ，noticing that this is a theoretical number that has not been observed at some time point (it is in general different from $A _ { s } = A _ { s } ( r _ { s } , x _ { s } ) ,$ ).Given this,we decompose the PnL due to a change in asset values as folows,taking into account the three different driving factors interest rate $( r )$ ，market risk（ $x$ ),as well as carry (due to time $t$ passing): ",
