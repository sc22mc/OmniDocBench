To avoid modeling the obstacles by hand, we followed an automated procedure to generate a plethora of different obstacles based on several parameters,such as depth,ellipticity and size.An example of a frame in the CARLA simulator with a simulated pothole is presented in Fig.B(texture) and in Fig.(geometry).

In the case of partial or conditional driving automation, our framework could be used to prepare the driver to quickly take the control of the vehicle,if requested. In order to ensure that the driver is able to swiftly take over the control of the vehicle in an efficient way, we developed a notification system that presents relevant information about the condition of the environment. Our notification system is based on non-intrusive visual cues to prevent tunnel visioning,alerting the driver of potential risks and also directing his/her attention to the objects of interest that sparked the take-over request. In that way,in addition to assisting the human operator during manual driving,the system can,in times of automated driving, trigger the attention of the operator to possible external hazards and preparing him/her to resume control.The visualization technique presented in this section is designed asan AR windshield interface,although this is not restrictive,i.e.the method can be implemented in any AR interface.
