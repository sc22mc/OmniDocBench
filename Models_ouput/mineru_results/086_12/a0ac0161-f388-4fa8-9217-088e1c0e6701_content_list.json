Hence, exploring and integrating these techniques could provide better features to process the hyperspectral data. ",

Vegetation indicesare obtained by combining spectral features of multispectral satellite images at the VNIR range of the green plants [223].However, for hyperspectral images,vegetation indices are defined at the plants’mediumandNIR bands to detect the diseases.The vegetation indices simplify the processing of the hyperspectralimagesas they focus on particularbands where the conditions or changes are observed.This helps to reduce the processing cost of hyperspectral images as well [176].

        "text": "Although vegetation indices provide good results, they take the hyperspectral images’ full spectral information. Therefore, a combination of other techniques such as PCA,linear discriminant analysis (LDA),and minimumnoise fraction techniques (MNF） [17] can be used to improve the feature extraction process.PCA can capture the important features in the spectral data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The LDA can thenbe employed to improve the separabilityof the diseasedand healthy datasets in the feature space.MNF can help to discard the redundant noisy spectral information and focus on theimportant spectral band information.The combination of feature extraction algorithms improves the overall performance of the models,as it can now focus on the most informative aspects of the data [227]. 3）Modeling and Data Interpretation:The final step of the hyperspectral image analysisis to choose a model based on the target/objective of the research.For instance,regression or classification models can be employed for plant disease diagnosis/detection.Regression models aim to predict the targeted variable (such as disease),and the classificationmodelsaim to distinguish target variables [17]. Generally,two types of models are used to perform the hyperspectral images:1）machinelearning-based classification models,which include neural network [254], SVM[158], random forest (RF) [255],k-nearest neighbor (kNN) [256], spectral angle mapper (SAM) [257], and maximum likelihood algorithms [258]; and 2) regressionbased models,which include partial least squares regression (PLSR）[259],Dirichlet aggregation regression [7], logistic regression [260],and multiple linear regression [261]. Neural networks are machine-learning-based algorithms consisting of interconnected nodes that learn the pattern and perform the prediction. The neural network is trained on the labeled images/data of the plants.Once the training is completed, the neural network can be used for predicting the health condition of the plants in the new datasets or unlabeled datasets [3], [262]. SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that helps to find the best hyperplane that separates data points of different classes.For plant disease detection,it can be used to differentiate between healthy and diseased plant samples based on their ",
