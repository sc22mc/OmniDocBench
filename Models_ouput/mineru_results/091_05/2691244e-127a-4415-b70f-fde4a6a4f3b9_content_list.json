The relative change in $C _ { s }$ gradually increased,with the most significant change observed on the second and third days as the banana entered the ripening stage.As subsequent days passed,the rate of change decreased, indicating the onset of aging. These findings align with the research conducted by[8],although their studyutilized a contact method instead. These various trends are accurately captured by the fitted data,which provides reliable representations of the respective samples. ",

        "text": "The simultaneous measurements of baseline and sample capacitance of three bananas over four days are presented in Fig.S3 of the Supplementary Material, revealing the electrical characteristics of bananas during the ripening process.Initially, all three samples show a gradual increase in the $C _ { s }$ valuesand thenreach apeak on the thirdday.This increase iscorrelated with the bananas transitioning from the green stage to ripe condition, during intracellular biochemical transformations that affect the dielectric properties of the fruit thus increasing the measured capacitance.Following this peak,there is a significant drop on the fourth day,likely indicative of aging and temperature reduction. Simultaneously, the baseline capacitance measurements for the corresponding days followa similar trend,while consistently having lower values in comparison to the banana measurements. A similar trend suggests environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, have an impact on the air's permittivity between the plates,which affects the capacitive measurement [18]. However,the measurements ofbananas taken on the second and third days with the pronounced peaks and sharper slope changes on this day reveal the dominant effect of the biological charges on its capacitive properties. On day four, the slope of both banana and baseline measurements become more comparable,suggesting a stabilization in the rate of biological change within the banana and potential equilibriumbetween environmental influences on the capacitance values.Fig. S4 of the Supplementary Material demonstrates the direct influence of the bananas’changing mass on their electrical properties. Such mass loss is likely due to moisture loss,increase in total soluble solids [31],and metabolic changes during ripening [32]. Here,an initial rise in capacitance when the bananas lose mass, mostly from water loss,can be observed. Also in the ripening stage,during intracellular biochemical transformations conversion of starches to sugar [33] will increase the number of ions. This phenomenon enhances the polarization of the ions in the presence of the applied electric field,which allows to store more electrical charge and as a result,the capacitance increases. On the other hand,by the fourth day,ethylene production rises during ripening [34],which leads to loss of structural integrity [35] and as a result,the bananas’dielectric constant, and thus capacitance, decreased. This comprehensive representation highlights the complex relationship between the physical and electrical characteristics of bananas during their ripening cycle. ",

The frequency range of $1 0 \\mathrm { H z } { \\mathrm { - } } 1 \\mathrm { k H z }$ has been excluded for plotting purposes due to significant noise,which affects the analysis's accuracy. According to Fig.4,while each condition displayed different $C _ { s }$ values,the changing trend of damaged fruit was consistent with undamaged fruit. Immediately after the damage, at the so-called $^ { 0 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ ,the $C _ { s }$ increases for the whole frequency range.This effect becomes more pronounced after $^ \\mathrm { ~ 1 ~ h ~ }$ The observed changes in $C _ { s }$ can be interpreted from the viewpoint of impedance spectroscopy. The increase in $C _ { s }$ canbe attributed to several factorsrelated to the mechanical damage sustained by cell membranes. Such damage likely ruptures cell walls, leading to leakage of cellular contents such as water,ions, and enzymes [36].Ions are the primary current carriers in an electrolyte,contributing to the overall impedance of the tissues. In the tissues shocks or stress causes cytoplasmic electrolytes to leak into the apoplast,decreasing the structure's electrical resistance to subsequent physical injury and ultimately resulting in cell destruction [37]. This result aligns with [38], [39], [40]. ",
