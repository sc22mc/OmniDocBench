The most wellknown task is image captioning，describing the content of an image in words. Many of the studies proposed novel methods to generate a textual description for GUI image, in order to enhance app accessibility [11], [62], [14],[15], screen navigation 63], [64], GUI design search 65],[66, [67],automate testing [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], etc. Chen et al. [13 designed an approach that uses a machine translator to translate a GUI screenshot into a GUI skeleton, a functional natural language description of GUI structure. Moran et al. [12l proposed image captioning methods Clarity to describe the GUI functionalities in varying granularity. In contrast，we focused on a more difficult task - video captioning，generating natural language to describe the semantic content of a sequence of images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work translating the GUI recording into textual descriptions. ",

These models showed their advantage in video summarization,but it was hard to achieve the goal of generating multiple concrete captions with their temporal locations from the video (a.k.a dense video captioning). Intuitively, dense video captioning can be decomposed into two phases:event segmentation and event description.Existing methods tackled these two sub-problems using event proposal and captioning modules,and exploited two ways to combine them for dense video captioning. We borrowed the two-phase idea to generate a natural language description for GUI recording, denoting events as user actions. ",

However, these methods were designed for general videos which contain more natural scenes like human, plants,animals,etc.Different from those videos,our GUI recordings belonged to artificial artifacts with different image motions (i.e.，GUI rendering).While some previous studies worked on domain-specific GUI recordings,they focused on high-level GUI understanding,such as duplicate bug detection $\\textcircled { 6 0 }$ ,GUI animation linting [79], [80], etc.In contrast,we focused on the fine-grained user actions in the GUI recording.
