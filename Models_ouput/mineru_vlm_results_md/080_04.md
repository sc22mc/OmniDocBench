Fact 1. Let  $\mathcal{A}$  be a PFA and  $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$  be its power automaton. Then  $\mathcal{A}$  is carefully synchronizing if and only if for some state  $q\in \mathcal{Q}$  there exists a path in  $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$  from  $Q$  to  $\{q\}$ . The shortest synchronizing word for  $\mathcal{A}$  corresponds to the shortest such path in  $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$ .

An example of a carefully synchronizing automaton  $\mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{car}}$  is depicted in Fig. 2. One of its carefully synchronizing words is  $aa(bb)^3 bbab$ .

We recall the result of Vorel [26] about the complexity of deciding whether a PFA is carefully synchronizing.

Theorem 1. Given a PFA  $\mathcal{A} = (Q,\Sigma ,\delta)$ , checking if  $\mathcal{A}$  is carefully synchronizing is  $PSPACE$ - complete even for  $[\Sigma ] = 2$ .

Further we assume that  $\Sigma = \{a,b\}$  and the letter  $a$  is defined for all the states wherever not mentioned otherwise. Having that we can go to the description of our method.

Let a plain text be the word  $u\in \{0,1\}^{+}$ . Choose a public key to be a carefully synchronizing PFA  $\mathcal{A} = (Q,\Sigma ,\delta)$  and a private key to be any word  $w$  that carefully synchronizes  $\mathcal{A}$ . For simplicity of further statements we note  $\mathcal{A}_i =$
