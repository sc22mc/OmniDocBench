The reasoning steps are repetitive and do not lead to the desired result of 24.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Reasoning step 1: This step is a logical inference of the given numbers and follows the rules of the game. Multiplying 4 and 10 gives 40, and the remaining numbers are 5 and 11. However, this step does not contribute to the correct solution of reaching 24.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Reasoning step 2: This step is a repetition of step 1.
