announce that Conjecture  $\mathbb{B}$  has been verified to hold for prime  $p \leq 2^{30}$ . Applying Corollary  $\mathbb{B}$  we are able to extend the range of prime numbers  $p$  such that Conjecture  $\mathbb{B}$  holds.

For  $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$ , let

$$
b(\ell) = (2^{\omega (\ell)}(\ell -3 - \delta) + 2)^2 -2
$$

be the lower bound appearing in Theorem  $\mathbb{A}$ . Suppose that  $p$  is a prime number such that the index  $\ell_0$  of  $H$  in  $\mathbb{F}_p^\times$  satisfying  $b(\ell_0) \leq 2^{30}$ , then either  $p \leq 2^{30}$  or  $p > 2^{30} \geq b(\ell_0)$ . It follows that Conjecture  $\mathbb{C}$  holds for this prime number  $p$ . This leads to the question about the integer  $\ell$  such that  $b(\ell) \leq 2^{30}$ . The answer depends on the number of distinct prime divisors of  $\ell$ . For  $\omega (\ell) < 4$ , one can check that  $b(\ell) \leq 2^{30}$  if one of the following conditions holds:

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\ell < 16411\mathrm{~with~}\omega (\ell) = 1,\\ \ell < 8197\mathrm{~with~}\omega (\ell) = 2,\\ \ell < 4100\mathrm{~with~}\omega (\ell) = 3. \end{array} \right.
$$

Moreover, one also has  $b(\ell) \leq 2^{30}$  whenever  $\ell < 2070$ . As a consequence, we have the following result.

Theorem 5.1. Conjecture  $\mathbb{C}$  holds for primes  $p$  with  $\ell_0$  satisfying one of the following conditions

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\ell_0< 16411\mathrm{~with~}\omega (\ell_0) = 1,\\ \ell_0< 8197\mathrm{~with~}\omega (\ell_0) = 2,\\ \ell_0< 4100\mathrm{~with~}\omega (\ell_0) = 3,\\ \ell_0< 2070. \end{array} \right.
$$

For an integer  $\ell$  such that  $b(\ell) > 2^{30}$ , we consider the set of prime numbers between  $2^{30}$  and  $b(\ell)$ . Let

$$
P(\ell) = \left\{\mathrm{primes}p > 2^{30}\mid [\mathbb{F}_p^\times :\langle -1,2\rangle ] = \ell \mathrm{and}p< b(\ell)\right\} .
$$

For prime numbers in  $P(\ell)$ , we verify Conjecture  $\mathbb{C}$  by the aid of computer for the computations. For instance, we obtain that  $P(2070) = \emptyset$  and hence Conjecture  $\mathbb{C}$  holds for prime numbers  $p$  with  $\ell_0 = 2070$ . By computer search, there are 423 primes in the union of  $P(\ell)$  for  $2070 \leq \ell \leq 3000$ . The largest prime number in the union is 7324065841 with  $\ell = 2730$ . We have checked that Conjecture  $\mathbb{C}$  holds for these prime numbers.

Theorem 5.2. Conjecture  $\mathbb{C}$  holds for primes  $p$  such that  $[\mathbb{F}_p^\times : \langle - 1, 2 \rangle ] \leq 3000$ .

For the solvability of Equation (3), we have the following simple observation.

Proposition 5.3. Let  $\ell$  be a proper divisor of  $q - 1$  and  $\ell '\mid \ell$ . Suppose that Equation (3) is solvable over  $\mathbb{F}_q$  for exponent  $\ell$  then it is also solvable for exponent  $\ell '$ .

Proposition 5.3 leads to the following consideration for  $q = p$ , a prime number, and  $\ell = \frac{p - 1}{2}$  in Equation (3). In this case,  $L = \{\pm 1\}$  and it suffices to consider the four possibilities  $\pm g^2 \pm g + 1 = 0$  where  $g \in \mathbb{N}$  is a primitive root modulo  $p$  (i.e.  $g$  is a generator of  $\mathbb{F}_p^\times$ ). Clearly,  $g^2 \pm g + 1 = 0$  if and only if  $g^3 = \pm 1$ , and then  $p - 1 = 3, 6$ .
