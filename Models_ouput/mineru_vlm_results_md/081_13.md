Figure 14. A measure of r-process strength across our parameter space, using a wave frequency of  $2 \times 10^{3}$  rad  $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  and  $Y_{e,\mathrm{eq}} = 0.48$ , and assuming the waves immediately shock and begin to deposit heat into the wind. We see that for higher, but still quite reasonable wave luminosities, r-processing takes place nearly independent of PNS mass and neutrino luminosity. The r-processing parameter space broadens to very low wave luminosities at higher masses as the wave stress becomes significant.
