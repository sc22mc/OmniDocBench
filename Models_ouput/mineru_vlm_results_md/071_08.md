is in  $\mathbb{Z}[x]$  and is of discriminant exactly  $3^{4}D$ .

Consider the element  $\lambda = \frac{\frac{B}{4} + \sqrt{D^{\prime}}}{2} = \frac{b + \sqrt{D^{\prime}}}{2} \in \mathcal{O}_{D^{\prime}}$ . We see that

$$
\lambda \bar{\lambda} = (\frac{A}{4})^{3} = a^{3}
$$

and

$$
\lambda +\bar{\lambda} = \frac{B}{4} = b.
$$

Given the polynomial  $g(x) \in \mathbb{Z}(x)$  above, Proposition 4.1(1)] implies that  $\lambda$  is a 3- virtual unit.

Denote by  $\Lambda$  the element of  $K_{D^{\prime}}^{\times}$ :

$$
\Lambda = 2^{3}\lambda = \frac{2B + 8\sqrt{D^{\prime}}}{2} = B + 4\sqrt{D^{\prime}}\in K_{D^{\prime}}^{\times}.
$$

We recognise that  $\Lambda$  is the image of the point  $P = (A, B)$  under the Fundamental 3- Descent Map  $\Psi$ , as this map is described for example in [7, ยง8.4.4] or [1]. Since by [7, Proposition 8.4.8]

$$
\Psi (E_{D^{\prime}}(\mathbb{Q})) / \hat{\phi} (\hat{E}_{D}(\mathbb{Q}))\cong \subseteq K_{D^{\prime}}^{\times} / (K_{D^{\prime}}^{\times})^{3},
$$

then indeed, by Lemma 4.4  $\Psi (P) = \Lambda \equiv \lambda \in K_{D^{\prime}}^{\times} / (K_{D^{\prime}}^{\times})^{3}$ . Then, by [9, Proposition 4.1 (2)],  $g(x)$  is irreducible over  $\mathbb{Q}$ . Finally, we see that  $\lambda$  is a primitive 3- virtual unit and therefore, by [9, Theorem 4.4],  $g(x)$  generates a cubic field of discriminant  $3^{4}D$ , which leads to a contradiction since we are in the escalatory case.

Case (b): Both  $A$  and  $B$  are odd. Then  $g(x) \notin \mathbb{Z}[x]$  but the following polynomial  $f(x)$  does have integer coefficients and it is of discriminant  $8^{2}3^{4}D$ :

$$
f(x) = x^{3} - 3Ax + 2B\in \mathbb{Z}[x].
$$

As above, let

$$
\Lambda = 2^{3}\lambda = \frac{2B + 8\sqrt{D^{\prime}}}{2} = B + 4\sqrt{D^{\prime}}\in K_{D^{\prime}}^{\times} / (K_{D^{\prime}}^{\times})^{3}.
$$

We see that  $\Lambda \bar{\Lambda} = A^{3}$  and  $\Lambda + \bar{\Lambda} = 2B$  and therefore, by [9, Proposition 4.1, (1) and (2)],  $\Lambda$  is a 3- virtual unit and  $f(x)$  is irreducible in  $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ . Furthermore, since  $B$  is odd,  $\Lambda$  is a primitive 3- virtual unit and again, by [9, Theorem 4.4],  $f(x)$  generates a cubic field of discriminant  $3^{4}D$ , which leads to a contradiction since we are in the escalatory case.

Let us remark here that if 3 divides either  $A$  or  $B$ , then  $9|16D^{\prime}$  which is impossible. Hence, in both Cases (a) and (b) of Propositon 4.8 above, the irreducible polynomials  $g(x)$  and  $f(x)$ , both in  $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ , are in standard form, as this is defined in [9, Section 4.4].

# 5. THE CASE OF POSITIVE SQUAREFREE  $D$  AND FINAL REMARKS

A natural question to ask is what happens when we consider discriminants  $D > 4$  where the same equivalence relations (1) hold. In this case, the constant term  $16D^{\prime} = - 16 \cdot 3D$  of our elliptic curves  $E_{D^{\prime}}$  would be negative. By following the same steps of the proof of Proposition 3.1 and by
