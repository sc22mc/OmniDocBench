Remark 1. If  $H$  is infinite- dimensional and  $f$  is a bijective transformation of  $\mathcal{G}^k (H)$  preserving the ortho- adjacency in both directions, then  $X\to f(X^{\perp})^{\perp}$  is a bijective transformation of  $\mathcal{G}_k(H)$  which also preserves the ortho- adjacency in both directions. If the latter transformation is induced by a unitary or anti- unitary operator  $U$  ,then  $f$  is also induced by  $U$

The following example shows that the above statement fails for bijective transformations of  $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  preserving the ortho- adjacency relation in both directions. Let  $U$  be a non- identity unitary operator on  $H$  which preserves a certain connected component  $\mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  . Consider the bijective transformation  $f$  of  $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  defined as follows:  $f(X) = U(X)$  if  $X\in C$  and  $f(X) = X$  if  $X\notin C$  .It is clear that  $f$  is ortho- adjacency preserving in both directions.

Theorem 1. Let  $f$  be a bijective transformation of  $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  which preserves the ortho- adjacency relation in both directions. Then the restriction of  $f$  to every connected component of  $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  is induced by a unitary or anti- unitary operator or it is the composition of the orthocomplementary map and a map induced by a unitary or anti- unitary operator.

The restrictions of  $f$  to distinct connected components can be related to different operators.

# 3. A CHARACTERIZATION OF ADJACENCY IN TERMS OF ORTHO-ADJACENCY

If  $X,Y\in \mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  are not ortho- adjacent and there is  $Z\in \mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  ortho- adjacent to both  $X,Y$  , then one of the following possibilities is realized:

$X,Y$  are adjacent;  $X\cap Y$  is of codimension 2 in both  $X,Y$

Indeed,  $X\cap Z$  and  $Y\cap Z$  are hyperplanes of  $\alpha$  and  $X,Y$  are adjacent if these hyperplanes coincide; the same holds if the hyperplanes are distinct and their intersection is a proper subspace of  $X\cap Y$  ; we obtain the second possibility only when the hyperplanes are distinct and their intersection coincides with  $X\cap Y$

Lemma 1. Let  $X,Y$  be compatible elements of  $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  whose intersection is of codimension 2 in both  $X,Y$  .Then there is  $Z\in \mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  ortho- adjacent to both  $X,Y$  .For every such  $\alpha$  there are precisely two elements of  $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  ortho- adjacent to each of  $X,Y,Z$

Proof. The orthogonal sum of  $X\cap Y$  , a 1- dimensional subspace of  $X\cap (X\cap Y)^{\perp}$  and a 1- dimensional subspace of  $Y\cap (X\cap Y)^{\perp}$  is an element of  $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  ortho- adjacent to both  $X,Y$

Let  $\alpha$  be an element of  $\mathcal{G}_{\infty}(H)$  ortho- adjacent to both  $X,Y$  .The subspaces  $X,Y,Z$  are mutually compatible and there is an orthonormal basis  $B$  of  $H$  such that each of these subspaces is spanned by a subset of  $B$  .Then  $X\cap Y$  and the 2- dimensional subspaces

$$
X^{\prime} = X\cap (X\cap Y)^{\perp},Y^{\prime} = Y\cap (X\cap Y)^{\perp}
$$

are also spanned by subsets of  $B$  .Furthermore,  $X\cap Y$  is contained in  $\alpha$  and

$$
P = Z\cap X^{\prime},Q = Z\cap Y^{\prime}
$$

are 1- dimensional. Let  $P^{\prime}$  and  $Q^{\prime}$  be the 1- dimensional subspaces which are the orthogonal complements of  $P$  in  $X^{\prime}$  and  $Q$  in  $Y^{\prime}$  , respectively. Since each of the
