Figure 6: Fourth step of encryption.

The last step involves adding some number of transitions under letters from the alphabet  $\{0,1\}$  between states belonging to the same copy of a public key in  $\mathcal{B}$ . In that case we have added transition  $\rho (9a,0) = 10a$  (first copy), transitions  $\rho (7b,1) = 10b$  and  $\rho (8b,1) = 3b$  (second copy) and transition  $\rho (12c,0) = 7c$  (third copy).

# 4 Basic decryption

For that section we assume that we have a ciphertext automaton  $\mathcal{B} = (P,\Sigma ,\rho)$  constructed from a public key  $\mathcal{A} = (Q,\Sigma ,\delta)$ , and that we know a private key  $w$  which is a carefully synchronizing word for the automaton  $\mathcal{A}$ . First we state a lemma.

Lemma 1. Let  $Q.w = q_{l}$ . After removing letters  $x\in \{0,1\}$  from automaton  $\mathcal{B}$  we have that  $P.w = \{q_l^1,q_l^2,..,q_l^{|u| + 1}\}$ .
