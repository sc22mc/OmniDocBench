where we defined

$$
R = 1 - iff^{\prime},\quad \phi = \int \frac{d\eta}{f^{2}(\eta)}. \tag{44}
$$

Note that these actions in terms of the ladder operators are the same if we choose the  $\xi_{k}$  or the  $\pi_{k}$  representation. Therefore, since  $\hat{\xi}_{k}\psi_{0} = e^{i\phi}f\psi_{1} / \sqrt{2}$ , we have

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\langle 0|\hat{\xi}_k^2 |0\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\xi_k\sqrt{\psi_0^*}\xi_0^2\psi_0 = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\xi_k\left|\hat{\xi}_k\psi_0\right|^2 =}\\ {= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\xi_k\left| \begin{array}{c}{f\psi_1e^{i\phi}}\\ {\sqrt{2}} \end{array} \right|^2 -\frac{f^2(\eta)}{2}.} \end{array} \tag{45}
$$

To calculate the spectrum we just need to find the expression of  $f(\eta)$ .

The solution to the auxiliary equation (38) can be constructed from the solutions  $f_{1}$  and  $f_{2}$  of the corresponding homogeneous equation:

$$
f^{\prime \prime} + \omega_k^2 f = 0, \tag{46}
$$

$$
f_{1}(\eta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\left(\cos (k\eta) - \frac{\sin(k\eta)}{k\eta}\right), \tag{47}
$$

$$
f_{2}(\eta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\left(\frac{\cos(k\eta)}{k\eta} +\sin (k\eta)\right). \tag{48}
$$

Then the function  $f$  takes the form

$$
f(\eta) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{W}}\left(A_1^2 f_1^2 +A_2^2 f_2^2 +2f_1f_2\sqrt{A_1^2A_2^2 - \mathcal{W}^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}, \tag{55}
$$

where  $A_{1},A_{2}$  are  $\eta$ - independent constants and  $\mathcal{W}$  is the Wronskian:

$$
\mathcal{W} = f_1f_2' - f_1'f_2 = 1. \tag{50}
$$

The two constants must be set through initial conditions: we require that at the beginning of inflation, when all the modes of astrophysical interest today have a physical wavelength smaller than the Hubble radius  $\frac{k}{aH}\gg 1$ , the expansion of the Universe does not affect perturbations and therefore each mode behaves as a harmonic oscillator with constant frequency. Hence we impose that modes asymptotically approach Minkowskian quantum harmonic oscillators with frequency  $k$ :

$$
\lim_{-k\eta \to \infty}f(\eta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}; \tag{51}
$$

this is satisfied by setting  $A_{1}^{2} = A_{2}^{2} = 1$ , so that the expression for  $f$  is

$$
f(\eta) = \sqrt{\frac{1 + k^2\eta^2}{k^3\eta^2}}. \tag{52}
$$

Then, inserting this expression into the Spectrum, taking the large scale limit  $- k\eta \ll 1$  and remembering the dependence of  $\eta$  on the scale factor (32), the final expression for the spectrum is

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathcal{P}^{\mathrm{std}}(k) = \frac{k^3}{4\pi^2}\frac{f^2(\eta)}{2a^2\epsilon}\bigg|_{-k\eta \ll 1} = \\ = \frac{H_s^2}{8\pi^2\epsilon} (1 + k^2\eta^2)\bigg|_{-k\eta \ll 1} = \frac{H_s^2}{8\pi^2\epsilon}. \end{array} \tag{53}
$$

We have obtained the usual flat,  $k$ - independent Spectrum [3]

# B. Modified Power Spectrum

Here we will derive the Power Spectrum that arises from the Fourier- transformed Mukhanov- Sasaki variable  $\xi_{k}$  obeying the modified algebra (12):

$$
\left[\hat{\xi}_k,\hat{\pi}_k\right] = i(1 - \mu^2\hat{\pi}_k^2). \tag{54}
$$

Due to the modified commutator depending on  $\pi_{k}$ , it will be easier to work in the momentum polarization.

By using arguments similar to those in [22, 28], if we impose that in the momentum polarization the scalar field operator acts simply differentially, we can find the action of the multiplicative momentum operator  $\hat{\pi}_k\psi (\pi_k) = g(\pi_k)\psi (\pi_k)$  as

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}g}{\mathrm{d}\pi_k} = 1 - \mu^2 g^2,\frac{\mathrm{arctanh}(\mu g)}{\mu} = \pi_k; \tag{55}
$$

therefore the action of the fundamental operators is

$$
\begin{array}{l}\hat{\pi}_k\psi (\pi_k) = \frac{\tanh (\mu\pi_k)}{\mu}\psi (\pi_k),\\ \hat{\xi}_k\psi (\pi_k) = i\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}\pi_k}\psi (\pi_k). \end{array} \tag{57}
$$

Given the action (56) for the modified operator  $\hat{\pi}_{k}$ , the Hamiltonian  $\mathcal{H}_k$  for a single Fourier mode yields a time- dependent Schr√∂dinger equation with a modified kinetic term:

$$
i\frac{\partial}{\partial\eta}\psi (\eta ,\pi_k) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\tanh^2(\mu\pi_k)}{\mu^2} -\omega_k^2 (\eta)\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\pi_k^2}\right)\psi (\eta ,\pi_k). \tag{58}
$$

This partial differential equation (PDE) is quite difficult to solve, so we perform an expansion in powers of  $\mu^2$ :

$$
\frac{\tanh^2(\mu\pi_k)}{\mu^2} = \pi_k^2 -\mu^2\frac{2\pi_k^4}{3} +\mathcal{O}\big(\mu^4\big), \tag{59}
$$

$$
\psi (\eta ,\pi_k) = \psi^0 (\eta ,\pi_k) + \mu^2\psi^1 (\eta ,\pi_k) + \mathcal{O}\big(\mu^4\big). \tag{60}
$$
