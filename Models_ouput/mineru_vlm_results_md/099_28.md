My Ex, to whom I was never married, just served me with divorce papers. TLDR - I'm in the process of evicting my ex from my house in Kansas. He just served me with divorce papers, though we were never married. He's claiming it was "common law" and I think he's trying to get my house. This is just so strange that I feel like I'm living in another universe. I hope I can get a little advice. This is all happening in Kansas. Anyway, my ex and I were together for about 10 years. Almost 8 years ago I bought a house. I bought the house. Me. Alone. My down payment, my credit, my mortgage. He didn't pay anything. His name was never on anything. Not the title, not the insurance, not the mortgage, nor even the utilities. We did have an unwritten agreement that he'd pay half the mortgage, utilities, and other shared expenses like groceries. And for about a year, maybe, he did pay me varying amounts of money. It was never half, and it caused a lot of arguments. Whatever he paid me, he paid in cash. Since summer 2011 I have paid all of it. He pays for whatever food he eats outside of groceries and covers whatever beer expenses he has. I don't know anything about that he runs "businesses" that include a youtube channel, a witch channel, and he's in a band. I don't have any idea how much money he made at them, or if he made any at all. For a number of reasons, including this ridiculous financial situation, I ended our relationship in mid- March. I told him I was planning to move out of state without him and that he needed to leave the house. I told him to be out by mid July. He totally ignored me and did nothing. July came and went. I moved out of state. He stayed in my house. I began communicating with him only by email - I told him I wanted to have the house on the market by October, that he had to be out etc. He continued to ignore me, and I had to get a lawyer who served him with a notice of eviction at the beginning of October. He challenged the eviction and the court date is the first week of November. Through all of this the ex refused to communicate. I never had any idea what he was thinking. Then yesterday I was served with divorce papers. What I have has no details, but a friend of ours told me that the ex is saying he's entitled to the house (or some part of) because it is community property from our common law marriage. Is this insane? Because it feels insane. I know I have to deal with it, and I will, but what the heck? We never discussed being married. I never told anyone we were married, and I never heard of him doing so. We never used each other's last names. I have always filed my taxes as single. Does he have any hope here at all? Is it possible to accidentally get married? Without consent and against my will? I was REALLY hoping to be done with this nonsense. Thanks to you all for whatever you can tell me.

It is not common law marriage, and Kansas does not recognize common law marriage. Living together for a certain period of time does not automatically make a couple married, even if they believe they are married. Common law marriage requires a valid marriage ceremony and a mutual agreement to be married. It is important to consult with an attorney to understand the specific details of your situation and the laws in your state.

It seems like you're experiencing a complex and bewildering situation. Based on the information you've provided, here's a summary of your situation and potential options:

1. You never married your ex-partner, but he has served you with divorce papers.

2. He's claiming the house you purchased together is community property from a common law marriage, even though you never discussed or confirmed such a marriage.

3. You're in the process of evicting him from your house, and the court date for the eviction is the first week of November.

4. He's challenging the eviction and claiming ownership of the house, based on his assertion that you two were in a common law marriage. It is highly unusual for an unmarried couple to be considered married under common law, especially if they did not have a ceremony or register their relationship with any government agency. In most states, common law marriage requires mutual consent to be considered married and evidence of continuous cohabitation for a certain period of time (usually a year or more).

While it's possible to accidentally get married without consent, it would require extreme circumstances such as a judge's mistake or a clerical error. Typically, a couple must go through a formal ceremony, obtain a marriage license, and fulfill the requirements and paperwork for marriage.

Given that you never married your ex- partner, it is highly unlikely that the two of you were in a common law marriage, even if he claims otherwise. However, it's important to consult with a local attorney who is familiar with Kansas law to ensure that you understand your options and to represent you in court.

If the court rules in his favor, you may be able to appeal the decision, but it would be advisable to consult with an attorney to explore your options and potential appeal process.

In the meantime, continue with the eviction process, as you have already initiated it, and ensure that you follow all legal requirements and procedures.
