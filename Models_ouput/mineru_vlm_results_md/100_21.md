# Table 8: The 2-th Reasoning Chain with Comments of Table

The 2- th Reasoning Chain with Comments ###### Below is a reasoning chain containing reasoning steps presented in order:

Step 1, Current set: 10 8, Selected two numbers: 10 8, Operation: /, Computed new number: 1.25, Remaining numbers: None, New set: 1.25. Evaluate Score: 0.8. Evaluate Score: 0.8  Step 2, Current set: 10 8, Selected two numbers: 10 8, Operation: /, Computed new number: 1.25, Remaining numbers: None, New set: 1.25. Evaluate Score: 0.8  Step 3, Current set: 10 8, Selected two numbers: 10 8, Operation: /, Computed new number: 1.25, Remaining numbers: None, New set: 1.25. Evaluate Score: 0.8

Analysis Report: This reasoning chain cannot complete the task and reach the target correctly. The reasoning steps provided are incorrect and do not lead to the solution of obtaining a result of 24.

Reasoning Step 1: This reasoning step is incorrect. The selected two numbers: 10 and 8, are not present in the given number set of 3, 5, 6, and 8. Additionally, the operation of division () does not result in the computed new number of 1.25. The remaining numbers are also not correctly identified.

Error Report: The selected two numbers are not present in the given number set. The operation and computed new number are incorrect. The remaining numbers are not correctly identified.  Advice: - Ensure that the selected two numbers are present in the given number set. - Use the correct operation that will result in the desired computed new number. - Accurately identify the remaining numbers.

Recommendation or Reject Description: Reject. This reasoning step is incorrect and does not contribute to the correct solution.

Reasoning Step 2: This reasoning step is a repetition of Reasoning Step 1 and is therefore incorrect. The same errors are present in this step as in the previous step. Error Report: - The selected two numbers are not present in the given number set. - The operation and computed new number are incorrect. - The remaining numbers are not correctly identified.

Advice: - Ensure that the selected two numbers are present in the given number set. - Use the correct operation that will result in the desired computed new number. - Accurately identify the remaining numbers.

Recommendation or Reject Description: Reject. This reasoning step is incorrect and does not contribute to the correct solution.

Reasoning Step 3: This reasoning step is a repetition of Reasoning Step 1 and Reasoning Step 2. The same errors are present in this step as in the previous steps.

Error Report: - The selected two numbers are not present in the given number set. - The operation and computed new number are incorrect. - The remaining numbers are not correctly identified.

Advice: - Ensure that the selected two numbers are present in the given number set. - Use the correct operation that will result in the desired computed new number. - Accurately identify the remaining numbers.

Recommendation or Reject Description: Reject. This reasoning step is incorrect and does not contribute to the correct solution.  Confidence Score: 0.9
