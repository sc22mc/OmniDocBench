admits any carefully synchronizing word. For a given  $\mathcal{A}$  we define its power automaton (which is itself a PFA) as  $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A}) = (2^{Q},\Sigma ,\tau)$ , where  $2^{Q}$  stands for the set of all subsets of  $Q$ , and  $\Sigma$  is the same as in  $\mathcal{A}$ . The transition function  $\tau :2^{Q}\times \Sigma \to 2^{Q}$  is defined as follows. Let  $Q^{\prime}\subseteq Q$ . For every  $a\in \Sigma$  we define  $\begin{array}{r}\tau (Q^{\prime},a) = \bigcup_{q\in Q^{\prime}}\delta (q,a) \end{array}$  if  $\delta (q,a)$  is defined for all states  $q\in Q^{\prime}$ , otherwise  $\tau (Q^{\prime},a)$  is not defined. We also note  $Q,w$  as an action of a word  $w$  on a set of states  $Q$  under the function  $\delta$ . Let  $S\subseteq Q$ . Then we denote  $S.w^{- 1}$  as a preimage of  $S$  under the action of a word  $w$ .

We note that the above concepts can also be considered for deterministic finite automata (DFA), for which the transition function is total. We define an  $a$ - cluster to be a DFA  $\mathcal{A} = (Q,\{a\} ,\delta)$  such that the automaton is connected. In other words it means that such automaton is a cycle on letter  $a$  with paths that leads to the states of that cycle. The set of states that induce a cycle in the  $a$ - cluster is referred to as the center of the cluster. The depth of the cluster is the length of the longest path to the center of the cluster. If  $q$  belongs to the center of the  $a$ - cluster, the branch of the state  $q$  are the states that has a path to  $q$  that does not have any other state belonging to the center. Destination of the branch is a state in the center that has an in- transition from the last state of the branch. Example of the  $a$ - cluster is depicted on Figure 1.

Figure 1: Example of the  $a$ -cluster

Center of that  $a$ - cluster is the set  $\{3,4,5,6\}$ , the depth is 2 and there are two branches:  $b_{1} = \{1,2\}$  and  $b_{2} = \{\} \}^{\prime}$ . Destination of the branch  $b_{1}$  is the state 3 and of the branch  $b_{2}$  is state 4.

We define the sum of two automata  $\mathcal{A} = (Q_{1},\Sigma_{1},\delta_{1})$  and  $\mathcal{B} = (Q_{2},\Sigma_{2},\delta_{2})$  as  $\mathcal{A}\cup \mathcal{B} = (Q_{1}\cup Q_{2},\Sigma_{1}\cup \Sigma_{2},\delta_{1}\cup \delta_{2})$ . We can now state the obvious fact, useful to decide whether a given PFA is carefully synchronizing.
