varies. The photon flux variation in the reflection component ( $R_{\mathrm{P}} - R_{\mathrm{T}}$ ) is roughly two times larger than that of the Compton component below  $\sim 10\mathrm{keV}$ , and becomes less than 1/2 in the energy range above  $\sim 100\mathrm{keV}$ . We then plotted the ratio between the photon flux variation of the reflection and the Compton component between the peak phase and the trough phase, in order to show relative contributions from the Compton and the reflection component to the X- ray variability with photon energy. The QPO fractional RMS below  $\sim 10\mathrm{keV}$  is also larger than that above  $\sim 10\mathrm{keV}$  (see Figure 4), which suggests that strong variation of the QPO flux at lower energy band is due to the reflection component. Since the photon flux variation of the reflection component is determined by the variation of norm  $\times \mathcal{R}$ , the dominated role of the reflection component below  $\sim 10\mathrm{keV}$  on the QPO flux variation can be understood as the parameter  $\mathcal{R}$  of this observation is large.

A remarkable result is shown in Figure 4. Starting from above  $\sim 70\mathrm{keV}$ , the flux variation between the peak phase and the trough phase is becoming primarily from the contribution of the direct Compton component. Beyond  $100\mathrm{keV}$  or so, the contribution of the reflection component is negligible. This implies that detection of the LFQPOs at energy above  $\sim 100\mathrm{keV}$  simply means that the Compton component itself produces the LFQPO quasi- periodicity, although the reflection component dominates the LFQPO peak- trough variation below  $\sim 30\mathrm{keV}$ .

# 3 DISCUSSION

We have investigated the short- timescale X- ray spectra corresponding to the high and low intensity phases of the LFQPO (defined as peak and trough) in one Insight- HXMT observation of MAXI

J1820+070. The greatest change among spectral parameters between the two LFQPO phases is the normalization norm. The difference in the normalization represents the flux variation between the two phases in the primary Compton emission. In the energy range above  $\sim 100\mathrm{keV}$ , the Compton component overwhelmingly dominates over the reflection component, and thus the flux variation above  $\sim 100$  between the peak and the trough phases is contributed by the Compton component alone (see Figure 4). Therefore, the underlying beats that generate the LFQPOs should originate from the Compton emission. Under the framework of conventional Comptonization models, the Compton component is thought to originate from a hot corona. Our spectral analysis shows that the corona is not oscillating coronal temperature or electron density, since in our spectral fits, the temperature  $kT_{e}$  and  $\tau$  of the Compton component does not show apparent changes between those of the peak and the trough phases. Thus the LFQPO corresponds to a modulation in the photon flux of the Compton component, either through modulation of the seed photons or line- of- sight covering factor.

The difference in the reflection fraction  $\mathcal{R}$  between the peak and the trough phases demonstrates that the reflection fraction acts like an amplification factor of the variation in the primary incident Compton flux since the photon flux variation in the reflection component is determined by norm  $\times \mathcal{R}$ . The values of the reflection fraction in the peak and the trough phases are both very large (larger than unity) but different, which causes the flux change between the peak and the trough phases at lower energies (below  $\sim 30\mathrm{keV}$ , see Figure 4) is dominated by the reflection component. The effect of the reflection fraction is also confirmed by that the fractional rms of the LFQPOs at below  $\sim 10\mathrm{keV}$  is higher than that above  $10\mathrm{keV}$ . In conclusion, the modulation in the Compton photons produces the underlying,
