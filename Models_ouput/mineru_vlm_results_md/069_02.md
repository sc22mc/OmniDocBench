Figure 1. (a) The EEG, heart and breathing rate sensor for a real-time biofeedback and auditory control of ASC during meditation; (b) the LM35 precision temperature sensor fixed on the skin; (c). IR thermal image, wavelength  $8 - 14\mu \mathrm{m}$ , NEDT  $\leq 60\mathrm{mK}$  (shown in the LM35 sensor measuring the skin surface temperature).

[29] showed that the use of real- time biofeedback in ASC has a positive effect on 'active meditation' practices with long- term focused attention. Body temperature is measured in two ways: skin and core temperature by contact LM35 precision sensor, connected to a high resolution logger and thermal emission in  $8 - 14\mu \mathrm{m}$  area by IR imaging sensor  $(\mathrm{NEDT} \leq 60\mathrm{mK})$ . Both methods deliver the same temperature data, but differ significantly in terms of thermal dynamics: IR method requires open- skin regions that quickly cool down, while the contact method is best suited for measuring internal body dynamics.

Figure 2. Passive differential calorimeter. (a) Scheme of the setup; (b) Image of the system with two Dewar vacuum flasks with NTC thermistor immersed in  $1.5\mathrm{ml}$  of water and two air temperature sensors.

Setup with differential calorimeter is shown in Fig. 2 and extends the earlier work [6]. One channel is used for experiments, the second channel represents a control sensor. Each channel has  $15\mathrm{ml}$  of water in Dewar vacuum flask with NTC thermistor immersed in the fluid. Additionally, the air temperature is monitored in each section of the calorimeter inside and outside of the thermo- insulating box. Stabilized power supply is also measured by a separate sensor, the delta- sigma ADC with 24 bit sampling is used. In this work we utilize a passive scheme for the calorimeter, where a slow temperature variation is provided by a circadian rhythm in the laboratory (about 1- 1.5  $^\circ \mathrm{C}$  for 24 hours) and guaranties a high degree of homogeneity in temperature distribution. Differences caused by changes in the heat capacity of water samples are measured as symmetry breaks between channels, small fluctuations about  $10^{- 5}^\circ \mathrm{C}$  of relative temperature can be detected. This system is used to explore the heat capacity of para- and ortho- isomers of water [25]. In several experiments we use electrochemical impedance spectrometers [30] to detect effects on environmental sensors, see Fig. 7.
