whether the response (1) follows the given instruction and (2) is correct. If both answers correctly respond to the prompt, you should judge it as a tie.

Example 1:

Text: We report the development of GPT- 4, a large- scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real- world scenarios, GPT- 4 exhibits human- level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top  $10\%$  of test takers. GPT- 4 is a Transformer- based model pre- trained to predict the next token in a document. The post- training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT- 4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT- 4.

Prompt: What is GPT4?

Assistant A: GPT4 is a large- scale language- trained transformer- based model.

Assistant B: GPT4 can produce outputs.

Your output should be:

{"reason": "The instruction asks what GPT4 is, and from the original text, we know that GPT4 is a multimodal, large- scale model that can generate text. Therefore, Assistant A is the closer answer, while Assistant B did not follow the instruction well in providing a response.", "choice": "A"}

Example 2:

Text: Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users.
