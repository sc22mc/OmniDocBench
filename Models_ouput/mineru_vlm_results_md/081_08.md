Figure 5. Early entropy profiles for a  $1.5M_{\odot}$  neutron star with  $L_{\nu} = 3\times$ $10^{52}$  erg  $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  and  $L_{\nu} = 10^{-3}L_{\nu}$  with varied wave frequencies. For higher frequencies, the shock heating begins to increase the entropy in the wind earlier and has a larger impact when seed nuclei are formed. The impact of the shock prescription is illustrated by the black line, which shows the evolution of the entropy if the waves (with  $\omega = 2\times 10^{3}$  rad  $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  shock immediately instead of when equation 13 dictates.

Figure 6. Final nucleosynthesis results, using temperature and density profiles for a  $1.5M_{\odot}$  neutron star, with  $L_{\nu} = 3\times 10^{52}$  erg  $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  and using a wave frequency of  $2\times 10^{3}$  rad  $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ . A clear peak around mass 200 is indicative of a strong r-process taking place.

Figure 7. Final nucleosynthesis results, using temperature and density profiles for a  $1.9M_{\odot}$  neutron star, with  $L_{\nu} = 6\times 10^{52}$  erg  $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  and using a wave frequency of  $2\times 10^{3}$  rad  $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ .

and is far from the conditions necessary for producing the third r- process peak. Increasing  $L_{W}$  we find that the peak of the abundance distribution increases in mass until  $L_{W} / L_{V}\approx 10^{- 4}$ . Further increase of  $L_{W}$  from this point briefly reduces the mass of the peak of the abundance distribution, but above  $L_{W} / L_{V}\approx 10^{- 3}$  a strong r- process emerges. The final abundances for NDW models with  $M_{\mathrm{NS}} = 1.9M_{\odot}$  and  $L_{\nu} = 6\times 10^{52}$  are shown in figure 7. Between  $L_{W} / L_{V} = 10^{- 5}$  and  $L_{W} / L_{V} = 10^{- 4}$ , these models produce both the second and third r- process peaks, but between  $L_{W} / L_{V}\approx 10^{- 4}$  and  $L_{W} / L_{V}\approx 10^{- 3}$  production of the third peak is again cutoff and the peak of the abundance distribution is pushed down to lower mass. As  $L_{W} / L_{V}$  is increased above  $10^{- 3}$ , a strong r- process re- emerges.

For both sets of parameters, we find the interesting behavior that r- process nucleosynthesis is inhibited for  $L_{W} / L_{V}$  in the approximate range of  $10^{- 4} - 10^{- 3}$ . This turnover in the maximum mass number is due to the competition between the decreasing dynamical timescale  $(\tau_d)$  with  $L_{W}$ , which inhibits seed formation, and the decreasing entropy  $(s)$  with  $L_{W}$ , which facilitates seed production by increasing the density at which alpha recombination occurs (Hoffman et al. 1997). Figure 8 illustrates the correlation between the quantity  $s^3 /Y_e^3\tau_d$  and the total abundance above mass 150. Despite entropy no longer being constant during seed formation, we do observe a fairly strong correlation between r- process strength and this quantity. We find that as the wave luminosity is increased,  $\tau_d$  decreases slightly faster than the entropy, but eventually asymptotes to a minimum value of a few times  $10^{- 4}$  s. The entropy continues to steadily decrease, which creates the trough in  $s^3 /Y_e^3\tau_d$  as a function of  $L_{W}$  and gives rise to the window of inhibited r- processing we observe around  $L_{W} / L_{V} = 10^{- 3}$ . At higher  $L_{W}$ , shock heating begins prior to alpha recombination, drastically increasing the entropy. This, coupled with the reduced electron fraction at high  $L_{W}$ , reinvigorates a strong r- process.

Second, we consider the impact of varying  $\omega$  on gravito- acoustic NDW nucleosynthesis. As was noted above, increasing  $\omega$  results in an earlier activation of shock heating. In figure 9, we show the
