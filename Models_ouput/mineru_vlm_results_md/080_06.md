Figure 3: First step of encryption.

The first step involves summation of three copies of the public key that correspond to the three vertices of the word 01 encoded as a labeled path. The first vertex of the path corresponds to the automaton induced by the states with suffix  $a$ , the second - by the states with the suffix  $b$ , and the third - by the suffix  $c$ .
