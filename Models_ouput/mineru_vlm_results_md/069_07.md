Figure 10. Examples of experimental data from the phase 2: (a,b) control measurements as 'empty sessions'; (c) control measurements as 'non-targeted sensors' running in parallel to experiments; (d,e,f) another example for environmental data as in Fig. 9; (a) the same as in Fig.8 but in differential form; (h,i) the same experiment in linear and nonlinear regression; (j-m) examples of multiple sensor responses; (n-r) other examples.
