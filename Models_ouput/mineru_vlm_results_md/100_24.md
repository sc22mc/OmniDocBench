Step 1: This step is a logical inference of the given task rule. It follows the rule of selecting two numbers (4 and 10) and performing the operation of multiplication to obtain a new number (40). The remaining numbers (5 and 11) are correctly updated to the new set (40 5 11). This reasoning step is beneficial to the correct solution. This step is a logical inference of the previous step. It follows the rule of selecting two numbers (5 and 11) and performing the operation of subtraction to obtain a new number (16). The remaining number (40) is correctly updated to the new set (16 40). This reasoning step is beneficial to the correct solution. This step is a logical inference of the previous step. It follows the rule of selecting two numbers (16 and 40) and performing the operation of subtraction to obtain a new number (24). Since there are no remaining numbers, the new set is empty. The final result of 24 is mathematically correct and equal to 24. This reasoning step is beneficial to the correct solution.
Advice: No errors were found in this reasoning chain. The steps are correctly executed according to the given task rule.

The final result of 24 is mathematically correct and equal to 24 when evaluated.
Reasoning step 1: This step is a logical inference of the previous step as it follows the task rule of selecting two numbers (4 and 10) from the current set and performing the operation of multiplication to obtain a new number (40). The remaining numbers (5 and 11) are correctly updated, and the new set (40 5 11) is formed. This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it reduces the number of elements in the set.
Reasoning step 2: This step is a logical inference of the previous step as it follows the task rule of selecting two numbers (5 and 11) from the current set and performing the operation of multiplication to obtain a new number (16). The remaining number (40) is correctly updated, and the new set (16 40) is formed. This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it further reduces the number of elements in the set and follows the task rule of selecting two numbers (16 and 40) from the current set and performing the operation of multiplication to obtain a new number (24). Since there are no remaining numbers, the new set is formed with only the computed new number (24). This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it reaches the final result.
