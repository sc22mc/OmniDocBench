of  $e$  - folds given by

$$
N_{e} = \frac{1}{3}\ln \left(\frac{v(t_{f})}{v_{i}}\right)\approx \frac{t_{f}}{v_{i}^{1 / 3}}. \tag{7}
$$

In the next subsection we report the mechanism to realize the EU scenario.

# B. The Emergent Potential

A simple way to create a past- infinite exponential expansion and end it at a finite time  $t_f$  is to use a scalar field. Therefore we can add the scalar field term to the Hamiltonian (1):

$$
\mathcal{H}(v,p_v,\phi ,p_\phi) = \mathcal{H}_\theta (v,p_v) + \rho_\phi (v,\phi ,p_\phi)v = 0, \tag{8}
$$

$$
\rho_{\phi}(v,\phi ,p_{\phi}) = \frac{p_{\phi}^{2}}{2v^{2}} +U(\phi), \tag{9}
$$

where  $U(\phi)$  is a potential and  $p_{\phi} = \dot{\phi} v$  is the momentum conjugate to the scalar field. From the equations of motion we find that the scalar field obeys a Klein- Gordon- like equation:

$$
\ddot{\phi} +\frac{\dot{v}}{v}\dot{\phi} +\frac{\partial U}{\partial\phi} = 0. \tag{10}
$$

The ideal potential for an EU model has a plateau (i.e. an asymptote) at  $\phi \rightarrow - \infty$  and a well with an absolute minimum at  $\phi = \phi_f$  ; it takes the form

$$
U(\phi) = U_{f} + (U_{i} - U_{f})\left[\exp \left(\frac{\phi - \phi_{f}}{\mathcal{E}}\right) - 1\right]^{2}, \tag{11}
$$

where  $U_{i}$  is the asymptotic value in the infinite past,  $U_{f}$  is the minimum value and  $\epsilon$  is a constant energy scale parametrizing the width of the well. The form of the potential is shown in Figure 2 for generic values of the parameters.

For  $t\to - \infty$  we have  $\phi \rightarrow - \infty$  and the field is in the plateau of the potential; this implies  $\dot{\phi}^2\ll U$  and therefore the energy density  $\rho_{\phi}\approx U_{i}$  is nearly constant, playing the role of the Cosmological Constant  $\rho_{\Lambda}$  of the previous subsection. When we approach  $t = t_f$  the field falls into the well until it reaches the minimum  $U_{f}\ll U_{i}$  and the exponential expansion ends. (Note that it is possible to set  $U_{f}\neq 0$  to represent the late- time cosmological constant [16], but this is beyond the scope of this study.)

As mentioned before, the infinite time of inflation produces a finite amount of expansion; provided that  $v_{i}$  and  $t_f$  are respectively chosen small and large enough, a very large amount of  $e$  - folds can be produced as follows from eq (7), thus solving all the paradoxes of Friedmann evolution in a similar manner to the standard inflationary theory  $\mathbb{I}$  . However, analogously to the latter, this model is also subject to some form of fine- tuning and criticisms.

# C. Fine-Tuning

As mentioned above, some fine- tuning is needed in the EU to reproduce observational parameters, such as density perturbations of the order  $\mathcal{O}(10^{- 5})$  and a late- time Cosmological Constant  $\Omega_{\Lambda}\approx 0.7$  ; however, all inflationary universe models need some amount of fine- tuning. The specific geometrical fine- tuning problem in the EU models is the requirement of a particular choice of the initial volume  $v_{i}$  and of the primordial cosmological constant  $\rho_{\Lambda}$  or  $U_{i}$  . This choice must then be supplemented by a further fine- tuning: a choice of initial kinetic energy such that the inequality  $\dot{\phi}^2\ll U_i$  holds. Both conditions are required to attain an asymptotically Einstein- static state.

The authors of 16 17 acknowledge the necessity of fine- tuning in this model, but claim that the situation is not too different from any other inflationary model. Besides, they argue that the advantages of having a non- singular, highly symmetric initial state overcome the troubles of fine- tuning. However, the scope of this work is to provide a mechanism to generate an EU model with the minimum fine tuning necessary.

# III. EMERGENT UNIVERSE FROM A MODIFIED ALGEBRA

In this section we present a modified Heisenberg algebra, that in the classical limit translates to modified Poisson brackets, which is able to yield an EU- like solution without the need of much fine- tuning.

The modified algebra, inspired by quantum gravity and quantum cosmological theories such as PQM [13 25] and the Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP) representation [22, 26 28], takes the form

$$
[\hat{q},\hat{p} ] = i\left(1 - \mu^2\hat{p}^2\right), \tag{12}
$$
