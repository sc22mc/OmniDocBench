Additionally, as a result of the Schwarzian inequality, we have

$$
|\psi '(z)|\leq \frac{1 - |\psi(z)|^2}{1 - |z|^2},\quad (z\in \mathbb{D}). \tag{2.10}
$$

Moreover, from equations (2.8)- (2.10), we deduce

$$
|f^{\prime}(z)|\leq \left(|\psi (z)| + \frac{r(1 - |\psi(z)|^{2})}{(1 - r^{2})(\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}(r))}\right)|g^{\prime}(z)|.
$$

Substituting  $|\psi (z)| = \sigma$ $0\leq \sigma \leq 1$  ),results in

$$
|f^{\prime}(z)|\leq \Psi (r,\sigma)|g^{\prime}(z)|,
$$

where

$$
\Psi (r,\sigma) = \sigma +\frac{r(1 - \sigma^2)}{(1 - r^2)(\mathcal{LP}(r))}.
$$

We need to determine  $r_m\leq r^*$  so that

$$
r_m = \max \{r\in [0,r^* ]:\Psi (r,\sigma)\leq 1\forall \sigma \in [0,1]\} .
$$

Equivalently if  $\Phi (r,\sigma)\coloneqq (1 - r^2)(\mathcal{LP}(r)) - r(1 + \sigma)$  then we need to determine

$$
r_m = \max \{r\in [0,r^* ]:\Phi (r,\sigma)\geq 0\forall \sigma \in [0,1]\} .
$$

Since  $\partial \Phi /\partial \sigma = - r< 0$  , then  $\begin{array}{r}\max_{\sigma \in [0,1]}\Phi (r,\sigma) = \Phi (r,0)\eqqcolon \phi_0(r) \end{array}$  . Further it is evident that, as  $\phi_0(0) =$ $1 > 0$  and  $\phi_0(r^*) = - r^* < 0$  , then there exists  $r_m\leq r^*$  , a smallest positive root of the equation given in (2.7) such that  $\phi_0(r)\geq 0$  for each  $r\in [0,r_m]$  . This completes the proof.

In 2017, Peng and Zhong [22], introduced the class  $\Omega \subset \mathcal{A}$  , defined as

$$
\Omega = \{f\in \mathcal{A}:|zf'(z) - f(z)|< 1 / 2\} .
$$

We conclude this section by determining sharp  $\Omega -$  radius for the class  $\mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}}$

Theorem 2.21. Let  $f\in \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}}$  , then  $f\in \Omega$  in  $|z|< r_{\mathcal{L}}\approx 0.522\dots$  is the smallest positive root of

$$
4f_{0}(r)(\log ((1 + \sqrt{r}) / (1 - \sqrt{r})))^{2} = \pi^{2}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{c}{g_0(z) = z\left(\exp \int_0^z\frac{\mathcal{P}_0(-t)}{t} dt\right) = z + \frac{8}{\pi^2} z^2 -\frac{8}{3\pi^4} (\pi^2 -12)z^3 +\frac{8}{135\pi^6} (1440)}\\ {-360\pi^2 +23\pi^4)z^4 -\dots .} \end{array} \tag{2.11}
$$

This is a sharp estimate.

Proof. Since  $f\in \mathcal{F}_{\mathcal{L}\mathcal{P}}$  , then as a consequence of Remark 2.4 for  $|z| = r< 1$  , we have

$$
\left|\frac{zf'(z)}{f(z)} -1\right|< |\mathcal{LP}(r) - 1| = |\mathcal{P}_0(r)|.
$$

Due to the growth theorem as mentioned in [15] Theorem 1] and Theorem 2.2 we observe that  $|f(z)|\leq g_0(r)$  where  $g_{0}(r)$  is given by (2.11). Further

$$
|zf^{\prime}(z) - f(z)| = |f(z)|\bigg|\frac{zf^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)} -1\bigg|\leq g_0(r)|\mathcal{P}_0(r)|.
$$

Thus  $g_{0}(r)|\mathcal{P}_{0}(r)|\leq 1 / 2$  provided  $|z|< r_{\mathcal{L}}\approx 0.522864$  . Hence the result is established.
