Again,by assuming finiteness of the Tate-Shafarevich group,the non-degenerate alternating pairing on $[ \mathrm { I I } ( E _ { D ^ { \prime } } ) [ 3 ]$ implies that this group is of even dimension as an $\mathbb { H } _ { 3 }$ -vector space and we obtain the congruence relation

$$
r ( E _ { D ^ { \prime } } ) \equiv r ( S _ { 3 } ( E _ { D ^ { \prime } } ) ) \equiv r ( S _ { \phi } ( E _ { D ^ { \prime } } ) ) + r ( S _ { \hat { \phi } } ( { \hat { E } } _ { D } ) ) \equiv 1 \mathrm { m o d } 2 .
$$

The last two equivalences follow from $( \left| 1 1 \right. )$ and Proposition B.1

# 4. THE ESCALATORY CASE AND NO INTEGRAL POINTS

In the previous section we established that the elliptic curves $E _ { D ^ { \prime } }$ have odd rank. In this section，we will define a subfamily of these curves and show that this subfamily cannot have integral points.

Let us first recall a classical result of Scholz regarding the rank of the 3-part of the ideal class group of quadratic number fields. The interested reader may refer to $\boxed { 1 8 } .$ Section 10.2] for more details on Scholz's Theorem.

# Theorem 4.1. Reflection Theorem of Scholz

Let $d > 1$ be square-free. Let $F = \mathbb { Q } ( { \sqrt { d } } )$ and $K = \mathbb { Q } ( { \sqrt { - 3 d } } )$ .If $3 | d$ then let $K = \mathbb { Q } ( { \sqrt { - d / 3 } } )$ .Then $r _ { F } \leq r _ { K } \leq r _ { F } + 1$ ■

Definition 4.2. With notation as in Theorem4.1, we define as escalatory the case where $r _ { K } = r _ { F } + 1$ and as non-escalatory the case where $r _ { K } = r _ { F }$

The terms escalatory and non-escalatory are used for example in Chapter 4]. Specifically, in Section 4.10 of $\bigstar$ ,it is shown that in the case of negative fundamental discriminant $d$ , the escalatory case is equivalent to the non-existence of cubic fields of discriminant $3 ^ { 4 } d$ . Translating this to our notation,we have

Remark 4.3.If $r _ { 3 } ( D ) = r _ { 3 } ( D ^ { \prime } ) + 1$ then there are no cubic fields of discriminant $3 ^ { 4 } D$

We will not explain in this paper the proof of this result.We only need to mention that the proof requires the use of the so-called 3-virtual units, which we also use here and we define right before Proposition $\lVert 4 . 8 \rVert$ These 3-virtual units live in the quadratic resolvent $K _ { D ^ { \prime } }$ and give rise to cubic extensions of $K _ { D }$ . The_interested reader will find all the necessary theory in $\boxed { 9 } ,$ Chapter4]and $\boxed { 6 } ,$ Section 5.2.2],and may find more on the relation between 3-virtual units, ideal class groups and elliptic curves in $\textcircled { 1 }$

Before we go on to prove that the subfamily of elliptic curves $E _ { D ^ { \prime } } ^ { \prime }$ with $r _ { 3 } ( D ) = r _ { 3 } ( D ^ { \prime } ) + 1$ have no integral points,let us show the relation between the non-escalatory case $r _ { 3 } ( D ) = r _ { 3 } ( D ^ { \prime } )$ and the existence of a cubic field of discriminant $3 ^ { 4 } D$ ，via elliptic curves,with the following example.Let us note that the discriminant $D = - 1 3 5 5$ of the example does not belong to the set of discriminants that we consider in this paper,since $- 1 3 5 5 \equiv 1$ mod 3. This is not important though since it does not affect the purpose of the example.

Example 4.4. Consider the negative fundamental discriminant $D = - 1 3 5 5$ We have $r _ { 3 } ( D ) = r _ { 3 } ( D ^ { \prime } ) = 1$ and so we are in the non-escalatory case. To show the existence of a cubic field of discriminant equal to $3 ^ { 4 } D$ ，which is
