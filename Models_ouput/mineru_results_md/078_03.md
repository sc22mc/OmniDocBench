of $e \mathrm { - }$ folds given by

$$
N _ { e } = \frac { 1 } { 3 } \ln \biggl ( \frac { v ( t _ { f } ) } { v _ { i } } \biggr ) \approx \frac { t _ { f } } { v _ { i } ^ { 1 / 3 } } .
$$

In the next subsection we report the mechanism to realize the EU scenario.

# B.The Emergent Potential

A simple way to create a past-infinite exponential expansion and end itat a finite time $t _ { f }$ is to use a scalar field.Therefore we can add the scalar feld term to the Hamiltonian $( \underline { { 1 } } )$

$$
\mathcal { H } ( v , p _ { v } , \phi , p _ { \phi } ) = \mathcal { H } _ { g } ( v , p _ { v } ) + \rho _ { \phi } ( v , \phi , p _ { \phi } ) v = 0 ,
$$

$$
\rho _ { \phi } ( v , \phi , p _ { \phi } ) = \frac { p _ { \phi } ^ { 2 } } { 2 v ^ { 2 } } + U ( \phi ) ,
$$

# C.Fine-Tuning

where $U ( \phi )$ is a potential and $p _ { \phi } = \dot { \phi } v$ is the momentum conjugate to the scalar field. From the equations ofmotion we find that the scalar field obeys a KleinGordon-like equation:

$$
\ddot { \phi } + \frac { \dot { v } } { v } \dot { \phi } + \frac { \partial U } { \partial \phi } = 0 .
$$

The ideal potential for an EU model has a plateau (i.e. an asymptote）at $\phi  - \infty$ andawell with anabsolute minimumat $\phi = \phi _ { f }$ ；it takesthe form

$$
U ( \phi ) = U _ { f } + ( U _ { i } - U _ { f } ) \left[ \exp \left( \frac { \phi - \phi _ { f } } { \mathcal { E } } \right) - 1 \right] ^ { 2 } ,
$$

where $U _ { i }$ is the asymptotic value in the infinite past, $U _ { f }$ is the minimum value and $\varepsilon$ is a constant energy scale parametrizing the width of the well. The form of the potential is shown in Figure $2 \ \mathrm { f o r }$ generic values of the parameters.

For $t  - \infty$ we have $\phi  - \infty$ and the field is in the plateau of the potential;this implies $\dot { \phi } ^ { 2 } \ll U$ and therefore the energy density $\rho _ { \phi } \approx U _ { i }$ is nearly constant, playing the role of the Cosmological Constant $\rho _ { \Lambda }$ of the previous subsection. When we approach $t = t _ { f }$ thefield falls into the well until it reaches the minimum $U _ { f } \ll U _ { i }$ ， and the exponential expansion ends. (Note that it is possible to set $U _ { f } \neq 0$ torepresent the late-time cosmological constant $\boxed { 1 6 }$ ,but this is beyond the scope of this study.)

Asmentioned before,the infinite time of inflation producesa finite amount of expansion;provided that $v _ { i }$ and $t _ { f }$ are respectively chosen small and large enough,a very largeamount of $e \mathrm { - }$ foldscanbeproducedasfollowsfrom eq $( 7 )$ ,thus solving all the paradoxes of Friedmann evolution in a similar manner to the standard infationary theory $\boxed { 1 }$ .However,analogously to the latter,this model is also subject to some form of fine-tuning and criticisms.

As mentioned above, some fine-tuning is needed in the EU to reproduce observational parameters,such as density perturbations of the order $\mathcal { O } ( 1 0 ^ { - 5 } )$ and a late-time Cosmological Constant $\Omega _ { \Lambda } \approx 0 . 7$ ;however,all inflationary universe models need some amount of fine-tuning. The specific geometrical fine-tuning problem in the EU models is the requirement of a particular choice of the initialvolume $v _ { i }$ and of the primordial cosmological constant $\rho _ { \Lambda }$ or $U _ { i }$ .This choice must then be supplemented bya further fine-tuning:a choice of initial kinetic energy such that the inequality $\dot { \phi } ^ { 2 } \ll U _ { i }$ holds.Both conditions arerequired to attain an asymptotically Einstein-static state.

The authors of $\boxed { 1 6 } \boxed { 1 7 }$ acknowledge the necessity of fine-tuning in this model, but claim that the situation is not too different from any other inflationary model. Besides,they argue that the advantages of having a non-singular,highly symmetric initial state overcome the troubles of fine-tuning. However, the scope of this work is to providea mechanism to generate an EU model with the minimum fine tuning necessary.

# III.EMERGENTUNIVERSEFROMA MODIFIEDALGEBRA

In this section we present a modified Heisenberg algebra,that in the classical limit translates to modified Poisson brackets,which isable to yield an EU-like solution without the need of much fine-tuning.

The modified algebra,inspiredby quantum gravity and quantum cosmological theories such as PQM $\boxed { 1 3 } \boxed { 2 5 }$ and the Generalised Uncertainty Principle (GUP） representation $\boxed { 2 2 } \boxed { 2 6 } \boxed { 2 8 }$ ,takes the form

$$
\left[ \hat { q } , \hat { p } \right] = i \left( 1 - \mu ^ { 2 } \hat { p } ^ { 2 } \right) ,
$$
