due to the strong out-of-plane anisotropy we experimentally observe, this contribution would be small.

We now discuss the mechanism inducing the crossover from a pronounced AFM towards an FM order as the number $n$ oftheQLsin theMBT stacking sequence in$^ n$ creases (Sec.IIB and Fig.2). Our calculations for the ordered MnBi $^ { - 6 }$ Te $^ { 1 0 }$ (Sec.IC）yield an- albeit small -AFM coupling. Although the increasing $K / 2 J$ ratio with increasing $n$ [21] certainly helps to stabilize the FM order for $n \geq n _ { \mathrm { F M } } = 2$ in our samples (see Sec.IIB and Fig.2c)，the fact that previous studies reported $n _ { \mathrm { F M } } = 3$ [22-25] hints at an additional phenomenon being involved.In sections $\mathrm { I I A }$ and $\mathrm { I I C }$ we have established the presence and the role of Mn/Bi antisite defects that can drive enhanced FM properties.As our numerical modelling has shown both for the MBT $^ { 0 }$ with thestrongest interlayerAFMcouplingand fortheMBT $^ { 1 }$ withaperiodic alternation of SLsand QLs,the motifof anintermixing pattern determines whether ferro- or antiferromagnetism is preferred.Hence,the observed magnetic properties of our MnBi6Te1o samples likely originate in a prevalence of intermixing patterns that favor the FM order.

Inthiscontext，acomparison betweenthe $\mathrm { M B T } _ { n }$ seriesandthe analogous Sb-based family $\mathrm { ( M n S b _ { 2 } T e _ { 4 } ) ( S b _ { 2 } T e _ { 3 } ) } _ { n }$ (MST $_ n$ ）becomesrelevant．The FM order is more dominant even for $n = 0$ in MST $_ n$ and MBST $_ n$ ，and,as widely accepted by now, is driven by the Mn/Sb intermixing [62-65]. This phenomenon is much stronger in MST $_ n$ than in MBT $_ n$ since it is facilitated by closer atomic radii of Mn and Sb.On the otherhand,the impact of the intermixing-induced FM statein MnSb2Te $^ { 4 4 }$ on its band topology is still under ongoing debate [9, 62, 63, 66-70]. Intrinsic p-type doping in MST $_ 0$ hampers clear-cut spectroscopic observations of the possible surface states and, thus,an ultimate conclusion about its topological nature. Furthermore, QAHE realizations in the MST $_ n$ have not been reported. In fact,Ref.[63] argues the importance of further studies on how intermixing impacts bulk and surface magnetism in the established topological MBT $_ n$ materials,but focuses on the MST $_ 0$ instead，because the necessary intermixings were not accessible by the bismuth analog at that time. So far intermixing in the MBT $_ n$ has been discussed mostly in the terms of its influence on the Dirac-point gap [71]，while the consequences for the magnetism are quite unclear. En route to understanding the broader role of intermixing,a recent study reveals its crucial influence on the magnetic coupling inMnBi $^ 2$ Te $^ 4$ [72],and our current work pinpoints the particular antisite defects that enhance (or suppress) the local FMcoupling in the MBT $^ n$ series.

We have established that the FM properties of our crystals are conditioned by the underlying cation intermixing. It is instructive to examine whether this relationship holds true for the other published works.Whereas Mndeficiency in MnBi $^ { 1 6 }$ Te $^ { 1 0 }$ is often found by x-ray spectroscopy [22，24,25]，the related intermixing has been scrutinized only in Ref.23.On the one hand, their and our samples have such commonalities as the presence of Mn/Bi intermixing,the absence of cation vacancies,and astrongly mixed occupancy on the $_ { 3 a }$ site.On the other hand,there are also substantial differences:The mixed $_ { 3 a }$ occupancy is more pronounced in our sample, in which we find $5 6 \%$ Mn (and 44% Bi), than in the sample studied inRef.23,which has 83% Mn (and $1 7 \ \%$ Bi).Most importantly,the Mn distribution over the $6 c$ positions is distinctly different:We observe a higher Mn concentration in both $6 c$ sites of the QLs,i.e.up to $\mathrm { B i _ { 1 . 8 6 } M n _ { 0 . 1 4 } T e _ { 3 } }$ vS. $\mathrm { B i _ { 1 . 9 2 } M n _ { 0 . 0 8 } T e _ { 3 } }$ in Ref.23,and up to $2 \%$ Mninthe outerpositions of the SL that are reported defect-free in Ref.23. In general, the $3 a$ site in our crystals is more Mn-depleted,so that these“stray”Mnatoms,which find no space on the $_ { 3 a }$ site,disperse over the entire layered stackby occupying $6 c$ sites.In accordance with our theoretical deliberations in Sec.IC (models S $^ { 1 }$ to $\mathrm { S _ { 4 } }$ )，the less pronounced intermixing and the presence of swapped Mn only in one of the two $6 c$ sites of the QLs in the samples of Ref. [23] accords with them featuring an AFM ground state.

The question of why intermixing takes place and which kind of defects are more likely to occur is evidently very relevant and,at the same time,a complex one.First, recent literature has shown that antisite cationic defects have the lowest formation energy and are energetically favorableto forminboth MnBi $^ 2$ Te $^ 4$ andMnBi $_ 4$ Te $^ { 7 }$ [73]. It has been argued that such defects provide an effective way to releasea lattice strain effect which occurs within theseptuple layerof MnBi $^ 2$ Te $^ 4$ due to a mismatch betweentheMnTeand Bi2Te $^ { 3 }$ structure fragments. Second,asargued below,variationsin the intermixing patterns ofMnBi $^ { - 6 }$ Te $^ { 1 0 }$ samples produced by different groups may stem from subtle differences in the synthetic procedures,pointing to the relevance of finite temperature effects for the relative stability of different defects.This would be no surprise since these compounds are formed at elevated temperatures and are metastable at room temperature as we have previously shown [31,32].

Comparing our growth conditions (see Sec. IV） for MnBi6Te $^ { 1 0 }$ to those of Refs. 23, 33,and 34 reveal differences indwelling times,the starting and quenching temperatures,and the composition ofa melt,which may well account for the various intermixing patterns. In general, we observe reproducibleMn concentrations and magnetic behaviorin ourMBT $^ 2$ crystals(Fig.2 and Fig.S4) for an applied tempering profile [31，74]，suggesting that the cation intermixing is a temperature-regulated phenomenon. We do not argue that this process is fully governed by the thermodynamics,since crystallization of theMBT $_ n$ froma heterogeneous melt is strongly kineticsdriven.Yet it seems plausible,that the resulting intermixing pattern is governed by a given synthetic protocol.Strong correlations between the synthesis temperatures and the resultant cation disorder and magnetic order have been,by now,undoubtedly established at least for MnSb $_ 2$ Te $^ 4$ [62,74, 75].
