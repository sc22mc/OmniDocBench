Conjecture $\boxed { \mathbf { C } }$ What we have shown in Theorem $\bar { | \mathbf { A } | }$ is that the improved lower bound has the order of magnitude $O ( \ell ^ { 2 } )$

TheoremA gives a sufficient condition for the truth of Conjecture $\mathbb { C }$ (and so are Conjecture $\bar { | \mathbf { A } | }$ and $\left| \mathbf { B } \right.$ in the case where $q = p$ a prime number and $\ell = \ell _ { 0 }$ . Thus,under the given sufficient condition an optimal CAC of length $p$ with $4 \nmid o _ { p } ( 2 )$ and weight 3 has the desired size.

Corollary B. Let p be an odd prime such that $4 \nmid o _ { p } ( 2 )$ ,let $\ell _ { 0 } = [ \mathbb { F } _ { p } ^ { \times } : H ]$ and let $\omega ( \ell _ { 0 } ) , \delta$ be as in TheoremAwith respect to $\ell _ { 0 }$ If $p \ge ( 2 ^ { \omega ( \ell _ { 0 } ) } ( \ell _ { 0 } - 3 - \delta ) + 2 ) ^ { 2 } - 2$ , then an optimal conflict-avoiding code of length $p$ and weight 3 has the size

$$
\frac { p - 1 - 2 \ell _ { 0 } } { 4 } + \left\lfloor \frac { \ell _ { 0 } } { 3 } \right\rfloor .
$$

Applying Corollary $\boxed { \mathrm { B } }$ we can establish the truth of Conjecture $\boxed { \mathbf { C } }$ unconditionally for primes with small values of $\ell _ { 0 }$ .For instance, if $1 \leq \ell _ { 0 } \leq 6$ then Conjecture $\mathbf { C }$ is true (see, Corollary $\left. 2 . 3 \right.$ 4.4and $\boxed { 4 . 5 }$ . Combining the results computed in [MZS14], TheoremA confirms the validity of Conjecture $\mathbf { C }$ for a large range of $\ell _ { 0 }$ .For instance,if $\ell _ { 0 }$ is prime power satisfying $\ell _ { 0 } < 1 6 4 1 1$ or if it has two distinct prime divisors such that $\ell _ { 0 } < 8 1 9 7$ ï¼ˆ then Conjecture $\bigtriangledown$ is true for prime numbers $p$ with $\ell _ { 0 }$ satisfying properties just stated (see Theorem $\pmb { \triangleright } . 1 $ and Theorem $\overline { { 5 . 2 } }$ for more cases).

The organization of this note is as follows. In Section $\bigstar$ we fix some notations and discuss some well-known facts related to Equation $\textcircled{3}$ . In particular,by applying Hasse-Weil bound, we give a proof of the facts that Equation $\textcircled{3}$ is solvable over $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ in the case where $1 \leq \ell \leq 4$ (Corollary $\textcircled { 2 . 3 }$ . Then, we collect and prove necessary results that are needed in the proof of the main result in Section $\left| 3 \right| ,$ One of the key ingredients is Ramanujan's sum which we recall in Lemma $| 3 . 2 |$ Section 4is devoted to the proof of Theorem $| \mathbf { A } .$ By appropriately organizing the character sum in the expression for the number of solutions to Equation $\textcircled{3}$ , we are able to obtain the desired bound given in Theorem $\bar { | \mathbf { A } | }$ for the number of solutions. In the final section,we apply our main result to the problem of the size of optimal CAC and deduce a large range of $\ell _ { 0 }$ such that Conjecture $\boxed { \mathbf { C } }$ (as well as ConjectureBand $\boxed { \mathrm { A } }$ hold.

# 2.PRELIMINARIES

In this section, we fix notations and present some facts that are related to the question of solvability of Equation $\textcircled{3}$ .Let $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ be a finite field of $q$ elements where $q$ is a power of the prime $p$ . Fix a generator $g$ d $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times }$ and a proper divisor $\ell$ d $q - 1$ .Let $L$ be the subgroup of all $\ell$ -th power of elements of $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times }$ . We have that $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times } / L$ is generated by the coset $g L$ and $\ell$ is the order of the cyclic group $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times } / L$

Recall that we're concerned with the solvability of Equation $\textcircled{3}$

$$
g ^ { 2 } X ^ { \ell } + g Y ^ { \ell } + 1 = 0
$$
