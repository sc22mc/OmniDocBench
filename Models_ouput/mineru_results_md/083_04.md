the Coulomb barrier,as discussed in Ref. [18].Below the Coulomb barrier,the average increase in fusion probabilitywas $1 5 . 5 \%$ and $3 6 . 9 \%$ fortheO.1 MeVand $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { M e V }$ temperatures respectively. Above the Coulomb barrier, the increase quickly diminishes to a few percent.

FIG.3.The increase in fusion probability for a $^ { 1 6 }$ O projectile and $^ \mathrm { 1 8 8 }$ Os target due to the presence of a thermal plasma environment.For each temperature ( $\tau = 0 . 1$ MeVand 0.5MeV), the fusion probability increase is calculated using the ratio of averaged thermal environment calculationsto averaged baseline calculations with no environment (Fig. 1).For the Gaussianwave packet，calculations were initiated with $E _ { 0 } = 6 0 $ ， 63,65,67and 70 MeVand for the Coulomb wavepacket, $E _ { 0 } =$ 65,67and70MeV.

The results in Fig.3are anadvancement onwork that showed that sub-barrier fusion is enhanced when channel couplings are included,due to the fusion contribution of excited states [29]. The thermal increase in fusion probability can be explained by studying the radial wave function of the entrance channel,

$$
\Psi _ { 0 } ( r ) = \sqrt { 1 - w _ { 2 } } \cdot \psi _ { 1 } ( r ) + \sqrt { w _ { 2 } } \cdot \psi _ { 2 } ( r ) ,
$$

where $\psi _ { 1 }$ and $\psi _ { 2 }$ are the radial wave functions of the ground state and excited state,and these wave functions also contain their respective energy basis states, $| 1 \rangle$ and $| 2 \rangle$ . The excited state Boltzmann factor calculated in Eq. (4) is denoted by $w _ { 2 }$ .Two effective Coulomb barriersare created from a linear combination of two dynamically coupled wave functions, $\psi _ { 1 }$ and $\psi _ { 2 }$ ，as shown in Fig. 4. This combination is anti-symmetric and symmetric, defining two decoupled eigenchannels, $\chi _ { 1 , 2 } ( r )$ ，

$$
\chi _ { 1 , 2 } ( r ) = \frac { 1 } { \sqrt { 2 } } \left( \psi _ { 1 } ( r ) \mp \psi _ { 2 } ( r ) \right) .
$$

The height of the Coulomb barrier for the symmetric eigenchannel ( $\chi _ { 2 }$ )issignificantly smaller than that of the anti-symmetric eigenchannel ( $\chi _ { 1 }$ ),leadingto an increase

of the fusion probability relative to a single channel calculation involving the state $\psi _ { 1 } ( r )$ only.

Temperature affects the fraction of the eigenchannels contained in the entrance channel configuration in Eq. (7）,

$$
| \left. \chi _ { 1 } | \Psi _ { 0 } \right. | ^ { 2 } = \frac 1 2 - \sqrt { \left( 1 - w _ { 2 } \right) w _ { 2 } } ,
$$

$$
\vert \left. \chi _ { 2 } \vert \Psi _ { 0 } \right. \vert ^ { 2 } = \frac { 1 } { 2 } + \sqrt { \left( 1 - w _ { 2 } \right) w _ { 2 } } .
$$

The inclusion of temperature leads to an increase in the initial population of the excited state, $w _ { 2 }$ ,and consequently there is a larger fraction of the eigenchannel $\chi _ { 2 }$ (with the lowest Coulomb barrier) in the entrance channel configuration.The effect is more prominent with increasing temperature,which is supported by our results in Fig. 3. Hence there is an enhancement of fusion probability in comparison to coupled channels calculations without temperature ( $w _ { 2 } = 0$ ）

Summary. We have addressed an area of unexplored territory by assessing the need for the inclusion of a reaction medium in stellar heavy-ion fusion calculations.The coupled-channelsdensity-matrix method,which is based on the theory of open quantum systems,unambiguously include thermal and atomic effects on subbarrier fusion dynamics. The calculations show that plasma temperature strongly enhances fusion probability. This pioneeringeffort suggests that careful considerations should be made when modeling or performing experiments on collision partners with low-lying excited states at high temperature. Despite no changes in fusion probability due to atomic effects, there is scope to reintroduce these effects when more experiments are completed and new theoretical studies arepublished.
