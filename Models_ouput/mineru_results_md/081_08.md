and is far from the conditions necessary for producing the third $\mathbf { r } -$ process peak.Increasing $L _ { w }$ ,we find that the peak of the abundance distribution increases in mass until $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } \approx 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ .Further increase of $L _ { w }$ from this point briefly reduces the mass of the peak of the abundance distribution,but above $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } \approx 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ a strong r-process emerges.The final abundances forNDWmodels with $M _ { \mathrm { N S } } = 1 . 9 M _ { \odot }$ and $L _ { \nu } = 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 2 }$ are shown in figure 7. Between $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } = 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ and $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } = 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ ,these models produce both the second and third r-process peaks,but between $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } \approx 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ and $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } \approx 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ production of the third peak is again cutoff and the peak of the abundance distribution is pushed down to lower mass.As $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu }$ is increased above $1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ ,a strong r-process re-emerges.

Forboth sets of parameters,we find the interesting behavior that r-process nucleosynthesis is inhibited for $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu }$ in the approximate range of $1 0 ^ { - 4 } - 1 \dot { 0 } ^ { - 3 }$ .This turnoverin the maximum mass number is due to the competition between the decreasing dynamical timescale $( \tau _ { d } )$ with $L _ { w }$ ,which inhibits seed formation,and the decreasing entropy(s)with $L _ { w }$ ,which facilitates seed productionbyincreasing the density at which alpha recombination occurs (Hoffman et al.1997). Figure 8 illustrates the correlation between the quantity $s ^ { 3 } / Y _ { e } ^ { 3 } \tau _ { d }$ and the total abundance above mass 150. Despite entropy no longer being constant during seed formation,we do observea fairly strong correlation between r-process strength and this quantity.We find that as the wave luminosity is increased, $\tau _ { d }$ decreases slightly faster thanthe entropy,but eventually asymptotes to a minimum value of a few times $1 0 ^ { - 4 } \mathrm { s }$ .Theentropy continues to steadily decrease,which creates the trough in $s ^ { 3 } / Y _ { e } ^ { 3 } \tau _ { d }$ as a function of $L _ { w }$ and gives rise to the window of inhibited r-processing we observe around $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } = 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ Athigher $L _ { w }$ ，shock heating begins prior to alpha recombination, drastically increasing the entropy.This,coupled with the reduced electron fraction at high $L _ { w }$ ,reinvigorates a strong r-process.

Second, we consider the impact of varying $\omega$ on gravito-acoustic NDWnucleosynthesis.As was noted above,increasing $\omega$ results inan earlier activation of shock heating.In figure 9,we show the
