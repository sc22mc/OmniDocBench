advanced computational photography techniques such as high dynamic range and night mode.However,smartphone cameras tend to have lower image quality as they have smaller lenses, sensors,and image processors due to the size restrictions of the smartphones [7],[11].

Hyperspectral cameras employ imaging and spectroscopy techniques to generate multidimensionalimage data.Every pixel in an image is assigned to spectral data that span a broad range of individual wavelengths [12].Hyperspectral cameras operatewithin $2 5 0 { - } 2 5 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ，which coversultraviolet (UV), visible,and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum[7].The advantage of hyperspectral cameras is that they help to focus ona specific part of images or area of interest,which contains the anomalies (e.g.,unhealthy/diseased partsof a plant leaf).This helps to establish special patterns or features to analyze the anomalies/diseases [1O]. The multispectral camera operates differently than the hyperspectral cameras.Instead of using hundreds of individual wavelengths,the multispectral camera operates within ranges of wavelengths.Multispectral imaging uses a camera to create images in specific wavelength regions,while multispectral spectroscopy provides data about specific frequency bands.Multispectral cameras have the advantage of being more cost-effective compared to hyperspectral techniques.However, they capture less detailed information about the captured object (plant/leaf) because they use a wider frequency band [1O].Fluorescence cameras capture images of fluorescence.Fluorescence images have higher dimensions than other imaging techniques. It can easily isolate the area of interest from the area of noninterest.However, they are not suitable for detecting early-stage diseases as the images lack clear differences between healthy and diseased plant tissues [1O].Thermal cameras are devised to capture radiation within the infrared wavelength spectrum. The collected data are then translated into false-color images,where each image pixel indicates a temperature value.However, thermal images are often influenced by fluctuating environmental conditions[7O]. Thismakesthemmore suitable to beused in controlled environment conditions [13].

Among all the abovementioned image acquisition techniques, hyperspectral imaging exhibits better prospects for early disease detection in plants by identifying minute changes in spectral reflectance caused by absorption or reflection.With hundreds of spectral bands,hyperspectral imagescan generateacomprehensive spectral profile,enabling the detection of slight variations in soil,canopies,or individual leaves.Hence,hyperspectral images can tackleabroaderrange ofissues related to accurate and timely assessment of agricultural crops’physiological state [14].

# II.FUNDAMENTALS OFHYPERSPECTRAL IMAGE SENSORS

Over the past few decades,hyperspectral imaging has been considered as a smart and beneficial tool for research analysis in various domains.The hyperspectral imaging system was mainly developed to merge the spectroscopic and image information so that the spatial distribution of different elements can be easilyidentified.The primary advantage of employing hyperspectral imaging over traditional RGB imaging is that hyperspectral imaging has the capability to capture detailed spectral information over multiple bands,which provides information for the spatial distribution of chemical components.Although hyperspectral and RGB imaging can be nondestructive, hyperspectral imaging provides the unique capability to visualize chemical compositions simultaneously.This section presents the principlesof hyperspectral image sensors,types,and available platforms to conduct hyperspectral imaging for plant disease detection [14],[18].

# A.Principle of Hyperspectral Image Sensors

Generally, hyperspectral imaging is the simultaneous acquisition of spatial images from several spectral bands measured froma remote platform. The spatial images and the spectroscopy in the hyperspectral image sensors aid in providing the physical,geometrical (size,shape,and color),and chemical composition.Apart from hyperspectral imaging,there are multispectral and ultraspectral spectral imaging techniques.All these spectral imaging techniques capture spectral images at different wavebands or within specific portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The only difference is that each spectral imaging operates in different electromagnetic spectrums and bands.Ultraspectral imaging operates in fine spectral resolution.Multispectral imaging operates in smaller bands,typically around 10-15 spectral bands. Depending upon a multispectral camera's specifications,it can sometimes capture even more than 15 spectral bands [19]. On the other hand,hyperspectralimaging canoperate in theUVat $2 5 0 { - } 4 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ,visibleandnear-infrared (VNIR)at $4 0 0 { - } 1 3 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ ,and short-wave infrared(SWIR）at 1300-25o0 nm. However, it cannot operate on other ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as $\mathrm { X }$ -rays or microwaves[7].
