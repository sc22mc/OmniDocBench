The robot canbe equipped with various end-effectors,such as grippers,cutting tools,and sprayers,to perform specific tasks.

# III.REQUIREMENTS AND CHALLENGES

The level of uncertainty in the agricultural environment is significantly higher than in other robotics applications.The agricultural climate is very complex in nature,meaning that it changes at all times.As a result,agricultural robots rely not only on advanced technology,but also on appropriate robot architecture,supported infrastructures,and services,such as communication between subsystems and data sharing and reuse. The unavailability of suitable robot architecture thatcan handle the existence of uncertainty in the agricultural environment may be one of the causes of this phenomenon.

# A. Requirements for Agricultural Robot Software Architecture

The overall requirements for the agricultural applications are listedin Table Ibelow,which should be considered while making arobot architectural pattern.

# B. Challenges in Developing Agricultural Robot Software Architecture

There are some challenges listed in the Table IIin developingagricultural robot software architecture considering all the requirements are as follows.

# IV.CHARACTERIZATION OFCURRENT ROBOTIC ARCHITECTURESANDPRINCIPLES

Robot architectural patterns define the overall structure and organization of a software system within the robot(s),and provide a blueprint for the development team to follow.In general, eacharchitectural pattern has its own tradeoffs,and the choice of pattern will depend on the specific requirements of the system being developed.Itis necessary to look for specific characteristics in architectural patterns that are appropriate for agricultural applications.Because warehouse or manufacturing-related architectural patterns may not be appropriate for agricultural applications,as it is highly dependent on environmental conditions, specific tasks,and goals,and because the agricultural field's environment is highly dynamic,uncertain,and unpredictable in nature.

# A. Categorization Based on Functionality

There are several ways to categorize robotic software architectural patterns,depending on the criteria or characteristics that are being used.For example,it can be categories based on functionality of the robot and how it performs its tasks.Examples include:

1ï¼‰ControlArchitecture Versus Cognitive Architecture:Control architecture focuses on the control of robotic systems, includinglow-level motor control and high-level planningand decision-making,while cognitive architecture focuses on the
