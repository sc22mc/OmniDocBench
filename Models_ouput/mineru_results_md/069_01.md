Abstract-Long-term focused attention with visualization and breathing exercises isat the core of various Eastern traditions. Neurocognitive and psychosomatic phenomena demonstrated duringsuch exercises were instrumentally explored with EEG and other sensors.Neurocognitive modeling in the form of meditative visualization produced persistent temperature effects in the body longafter the exercise finished;this raises the question about their psychosomatic or biophysical origin.The work explores this question by comparing experiments with focusingattention inside and outside the body.EEG,temperature,heart and breathing sensorsmonitor internal body conditions,high resolution differential calorimetric sensors are used to detect thermal effects outside the body. Experiments with 159 attempts (2427 operator-sensor sessions） were carried over five months,control measurements run in the same conditions in parallel to experimental series. Increase of body temperature up to moderate fever zone $3 8 . 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ and intentional control of up and down trend of core temperature by ${ \bf 1 . 6 ~ } ^ { \circ } \bf C$ aredemonstrated.Persistent temperature variations last $> \mathbf { 6 0 } \ \mathbf { m i n }$ ，Experimentsalso demonstrated induced thermal fluctuations at $1 0 ^ { - 3 } ~ ^ { \circ } \mathbf { C }$ level in external calorimetric systems with ${ \bf 1 5 ~ m l }$ of water for $\mathbf { 6 0 { - } 9 0 \ m i n }$ .Repeatability of theseattemptsis over $90 \%$ ,statistical Chi-squareand Mann-Whitney tests reject the null hypotheses about random character of outcomes.Thus, the obtained data confirm the persistent thermal effects reported in previous publications and indicate their biophysical dimension. Toexplain these resultswe refer to a new model in neuroscience that involves spin phenomena in biochemical and physical systems. These experiments demonstrate complexbiophysical mechanisms ofaltered states of consciousness；their function in the body's neurohumoral regulation and non-classical brain functions is discussed.

# I.INTRODUCTION

Neurocognitive and psychosomatic mechanisms of altered states of consciousness (ASC) in several Eastern traditions, such asReiki[1], Tai chi [2],Qigong [3], Johrei [4]andothers have been studied in academic publications.For instance, the focused attention on the body (abdominal region near the navel) inyoga Tummo has been shown to increase core temperature upto $3 8 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [5].Authors demonstrated that a neurocognitive modeling in the form of meditative visualization in ASC is responsible for two effects:(a) increasing temperature far beyond the range of normal body temperature; (b) persistent,step-wise temperature increase long after the exercises finished.Similar effects were described in other publications [6], [7].

Persistent effects were also reported for techniques targeting environmental objects and processes,such as exposure of external Qi [8]-[10] and focused attention [11],[12] to aqueous solutions and properties of materials [13],bacterial cultures andlaboratory animals[14].The practice of these techniques causes instrumentally recorded persistent changes in both the internal metabolism of human meditator and the properties of materials and processes.Comparing both results,the question arisesabout only psychosomatic or also biophysical origin of such phenomena. The work explorers this question in relation to long-term sustained temperature variations in two cases,when theattention is focused inside and outside the body.

This experimental study replicates and extends the methodologies of previous works [5],[6],[13] with practitioners of the six yogas of Naropa [15],[16] and the Dhammakaya meditation [17].Skin surface and core temperature are measured with IR camera (wavelength $8 \mathrm { - } 1 4 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ）and contact sensors.External effects are measured by high resolution differential calorimeters with6 temperature sensors and $2 \mathrm { x } 1 5 \mathrm { ~ m l }$ of water.Such calorimeters are able to measure extremely small $t$ changes asa symmetry breaking effect.A separate laboratory was prepared for measurements,three calorimetric setups served ascontrol systems and three others used in experiments,all systemsrunning in parallel.Additionally,the power supply, electromagnetic emissions,magnetic fields,air pressure and mechanical impacts are recorded by corresponding sensors. Meditatorsuse the real-time biofeedback with sensors of EEG, heart and respiratory rate,and muscle activity.

The obtained results confirm the persistent effects reported in [5], [6],[13]. In particular,increase of body temperature up to moderate fever zone $3 8 . 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ and intentional control of up and down trend of core temperature by $1 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ are demonstrated for ${ > } 6 0$ min.Experiments have also shown the induced thermal fluctuations in external calorimetric systems at $1 0 ^ { - 3 } ~ ^ { \circ } C$ level for $6 0 { - } 9 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ ，which point to biophysical dimension of such phenomena.To explain these results,the biophysical hypothesis consists in the spin conversion of water isomers [18]. The spin configuration affects chemical reactivity [19],[2O],behavior in electric field [21],magnetic moment [22], evaporation [23], surface tension [24] and other properties,in particular,the heat capacity ofwater isomers [25].Asa hypothesis,itis assumed that such a spin conversion induced through ASC,as recently proposed in neuroscience [26],[27] e.g. via non-classical brain functions [28], can cause the observed thermal effects.
