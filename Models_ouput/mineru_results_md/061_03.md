To check whether the peaks and troughs of the selected flares are consistent with the QPO waveform,we produced a power spectrum ofa faked light curve consisting of these selected flares.The interval betweentwoneighbortroughisidentified asa full flare,which corresponds to the QPO waveform with the time interval less than or equal $3 0 \mathrm { s }$ .Theseidentified flarescovered $\sim 4 0 \%$ of the entire light curve exposure (see the shaded region of Figure 2).We then generate two fakelightcurvesbased on the identified flare intervals.Oneis that the count rates during the flare intervalsare retained,while the count rates during the non-flare intervals are replaced by the average count rate specific to each interval. The other is that the count rates during the flare intervals are replaced by their corresponding average count rate,while non-flare intervals are retained.The PDSsof the above fake light curves are shown in red and blue solid lines in Figure 1. It is obvious that the power spectra of the faked light curve of flare intervals show strong LFQPO.The power at the QPO frequency of $0 . 0 4 4 \mathrm { H z }$ in the faked PDSof flare intervals is larger than that of the non-flare intervals byafactor of 2.2 for theLE band,2.O for theME band,and 2.O for the HE band,respectively.At the same time,the band-limited noise components,e.g.,the peaked noise in $1 { - } 1 0 \ \mathrm { H z }$ areconsistent with the same between that of the flare intervals and that of the non-flare intervals. The observed power of the LFQPO, especially that of the fundamental QPO peak,ismostly accounted forby those identified flares,demonstrating that the peak phase and
