Figure 7: Extended step of encryption.

Observe that we can apply Lemma 3 to states $1 , 2 , 3$ .Wealsoaddedcluster that consistsofstates $4 , 5 , 6 , 7$ so we can apply Lemma 4. In the former method wehad that ${ \cal Q } _ { 1 } = \{ 1 a , . . , 1 5 a \} , { \cal Q } _ { 2 } = \{ 1 b , . . , 1 5 b \} , { \cal Q } _ { 3 } = \{ 1 c , . . , 1 5 c \}$ andnow $Q _ { 1 } ^ { \prime } = Q _ { 1 } \cup \{ 1 \} , Q _ { 2 } ^ { \prime } = Q _ { 2 } \cup \{ 2 , 4 , 5 \} , Q _ { 3 } ^ { \prime } = Q _ { 3 } \cup \{ 3 , 6 , 7 \} .$

# 6Conclusions and further work

We proposed a method of utilizing careful synchronization to provide brand new public key cryptosystem. In sections 3 and 4 we presented core idea of ourmethod and provided an example that illustrates it.As the ciphertext in thatmethodconsistsof $n$ copies of the same automaton,those two sections are included to so the reader could understand the method presented in section 5. It should be also mentioned that lemmas 4 and 3 are only examples of extensions ofthat cryptosystem. Indeed, observe that Lemma 4 provides a possibility to add”free” $^ { a }$ -clusters to a ciphertext.The disadvantage of that extension is that
