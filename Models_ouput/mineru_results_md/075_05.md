subspaces $P , P ^ { \prime } , Q , Q ^ { \prime }$ contains a vector from the basis $B$ , the subspaces

$$
Z _ { 1 } = P ^ { \prime } \oplus ( X \cap Y ) \oplus Q \mathrm { a n d } Z _ { 2 } = P \oplus ( X \cap Y ) \oplus Q ^ { \prime }
$$

are spanned by subsets of $B$ and ortho-adjacent to each of $X , Y , Z$ ：

Consider any $Z ^ { \prime } \in \mathcal G _ { \infty } ( H )$ ortho-adjacent to each of $X , Y , Z$ .The subspaces $X , Y , Z , Z ^ { \prime }$ are mutually compatible and there is an orthonormal basis $B ^ { \prime }$ such that all these subspaces are spanned by subsets of $B ^ { \prime }$ .Then $X \cap Y , X ^ { \prime } , Y ^ { \prime }$ are also spanned by subsets of $B ^ { \prime }$ and each of the 1-dimensional subspaces $P , P ^ { \prime } , Q , Q ^ { \prime }$ contains a vector from $B ^ { \prime }$ .The subspace $Z ^ { \prime }$ contains $X \cap Y$ ,the subspaces $X ^ { \prime } \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ ， $Y ^ { \prime } \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ are1-dimensional and

$$
Z ^ { \prime } = ( X ^ { \prime } \cap Z ^ { \prime } ) \oplus ( X \cap Y ) \oplus ( Y ^ { \prime } \cap Z ^ { \prime } )
$$

（ $Z ^ { \prime }$ is ortho-adjacent to $X$ and $Y$ ).Recall that

$$
Z = P \oplus ( X \cap Y ) \oplus Q .
$$

Since $X ^ { \prime } \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ is a 1-dimensional subspace of $X ^ { \prime }$ containing a vector from $B ^ { \prime }$ ，it coincideswith $P$ or $P ^ { \prime }$ .Similarly, $Y ^ { \prime } \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ coincides with $Q$ or $Q ^ { \prime }$ .Then $Z$ and $Z ^ { \prime }$ are ortho-adjacent only when $Z ^ { \prime }$ is $Z _ { 1 }$ or $Z _ { 2 }$ $\boxed { \begin{array} { r l } \end{array} }$

Lemma 2. Let $X , Y$ be elements of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ whose intersection is of codimension 2in both $X , Y$ . If there are ortho-adjacent $Z , Z ^ { \prime } \in \mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ such that each of them is ortho-adjacent to both $X , Y$ ，then $X , Y$ are compatible.

Proof.We assert that $Z \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ is contained in $X$ or $Y$ If $Z \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ is not contained in $X$ ,then $Z \cap X$ and $Z ^ { \prime } \cap X$ are distinct hyperplanes of $X$ and their sum is $X$ Similarly, if $Z \cap Z ^ { \prime } \not \subset Y$ ,then $Z \cap Y$ and $Z ^ { \prime } \cap Y$ are distinct hyperplanes of $Y$ whose sum is $Y$ .Then $Z + Z ^ { \prime }$ contains both $X , Y$ .Since $Z \cap X$ and $Z ^ { \prime } \cap X$ are subspaces of codimension 2in $Z + Z ^ { \prime }$ ,thesubspace $X$ isa hyperplane of $Z + Z ^ { \prime }$ .For the same reason, $Y$ is a hyperplane of $Z + Z ^ { \prime }$ .Then $X , Y$ are adjacent which is impossible.

Without loss of generality,we can assume that $Z \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ is contained in $X$ . Then $Z \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ isa hyperplane of $X$ . The orthogonal complement of $X \cap Y$ in $X + Y$ is 4-dimensional and we denote this subspace by $M$ . Then

$$
X ^ { \prime } = X \cap M { \mathrm { ~ a n d ~ } } Y ^ { \prime } = Y \cap M
$$

are 2-dimensional subspaces whose intersection is $0$ .Observe that each of $Z , Z ^ { \prime }$ contains $X \cap Y$ and is contained in $X + Y$ which implies that

$$
S = Z \cap M { \mathrm { ~ a n d ~ } } S ^ { \prime } = Z ^ { \prime } \cap M
$$

are distinct 2-dimensional subspaces. Since $Z \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ is a hyperplane of $X$ and $X \cap Y$ is contained in $Z \cap Z ^ { \prime }$ ，

$$
Z \cap Z ^ { \prime } \cap M = S \cap S ^ { \prime }
$$

is a 1-dimensional subspace of $X ^ { \prime }$ which will be denoted by $P$ . The subspaces

$$
Z = ( X \cap Y ) \oplus S , \ Z ^ { \prime } = ( X \cap Y ) \oplus S ^ { \prime }
$$

are ortho-adjacent to $Y = ( X \cap Y ) \oplus Y ^ { \prime }$ and,consequently, $S$ and $S ^ { \prime }$ intersect $Y ^ { \prime }$ in certain 1-dimensional subspaces $P _ { 1 }$ and $P _ { 2 }$ ,respectively. The subspaces $P _ { 1 } , P _ { 2 }$ are distinct (since $S = P + P _ { 1 }$ and $S ^ { \prime } = P + P _ { 2 }$ are distinct).
