ered $\begin{array} { r } { \omega = 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { r a d } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 } , } \end{array}$ ),a full -process pattern extending through the third peak isproduced.Here,thewave heatingdue to weak shocks beginsbefore the start of seed formation.Therefore,the substantial increase in the entropy inhibits seed formation,and leaves a large neutron-to-seed ratio when alpha capture ends.This is mainly driven by the impact of $\omega$ on the shock heating activation radius,and less so by the variation in $l _ { d }$ with $\omega$ .Thisis illustrated by the model shown in figure 9 that assumes $\omega = 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { r a d s } ^ { - 1 }$ but an instantaneous activation of shock heating.This results in nucleosynthesis that is very similar to the $\omega = 1 0 ^ { 4 } \mathrm { r a d } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ model.

Therefore,asa limiting case given the uncertainty in the shock activation radius and to compare to previous work(Suzuki & Nagataki 2005; Metzger et al. 2007), we show in figure 10 final abundances for varied $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu }$ for $\omega = 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { r a d \ s } ^ { - 1 }$ ， $M _ { \mathrm { N S } } = 1 . 5 M _ { \odot }$ ， $L _ { \nu } = 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 2 }$ erg $\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ ,but with instantaneous activation of the shock heating.The results are noticeably different than those shown in figure6,which shows models with the same parameters but without instantaneous shock heating. For instantaneous activation,the averagemass of the abundance distribution increasesmonotonically with $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu }$ and for even moderate wave luminosities is able to produce a full r-process.This illustrates that uncertainty in the shock formation radius translates into significant uncertainty in the predicted nucleosynthesis for gravito-acoustic NDWs.

To illustrate the important impact of the reduced electron fraction from the wave contributions,we show in figure 11 abundance distributions from awind with $M _ { N S } = 1 . 9 M _ { \odot }$ ， $L _ { \nu } = 6 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 2 }$ ,and $Y _ { e , \mathrm { e q } } = 0 . 5 2$ .In the absence of wave effects,the neutrino spectrum used here should preclude any r-processing whatsoever. The wind would undergo an alpha-rich freezeout, leaving only free protons to capture onto seed nuclei.However,with wave effects included, we find similar r-processing regimes to those obtained with neutrino energies tuned to $Y _ { e } = 0 . 4 8$ .In the wave stress regime,with $5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } \lesssim L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } \lesssim 5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ ,the change in $Y _ { e }$ is not large enough to make the wind neutron rich,but the faster outflow caused by the wave stress prevents an $\alpha$ -rich freezeout from occurring.R-process elements are then synthesized from the free neutronsinthe wind, despite the wind being overall proton-rich.This gives rise to the suppressed,actinide-free r-process patterns in figure 11.In between the r-processing regimes,we again find a region where the combined entropy and dynamical timescale in the wind favor strong seed formation and thus no r-processing,regardless of $Y _ { e }$ or the presence of an $\alpha$ -rich freezeout.At high $L _ { w }$ ,the wind becomes neutron-rich again,and earlywave heating suppresses seed formationand drives the same strong r-processing as in figure 7.

# 5.2.3Nucleosynthesis in the $L _ { w } \ – \ L _ { \nu } \ – \ M _ { N S }$ parameter space

In figure 12,we show the total final abundance of nuclei with mass number $A \ge 1 5 0$ as a function of $L _ { \nu }$ and $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu }$ for a variety of PNS masses.Here,we have used $Y _ { e , \mathrm { e q } } = 0 . 4 8$ $\omega = 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { r a d } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ ， and assumed the shock formation radius is given by equation 13. We find the abundance of nuclei with $A \ge 1 5 0$ to be an effective proxy for the strength of the r-process in the wind (see e.g. figure 7). Two r-processing regimes appear. For the highest neutrino and wave luminosities,shock heating begins early enough in the wind to drive astrong r-process.This shock heating regime is fairly insensitive to PNS mass but very dependent on wave frequency,which sets how early shock heating can begin in the wind.The second r-processing regime,driven by acceleration due to the wave stress,is strongly dependent on mass but insensitive to wave frequency.We see this regime emergeata PNSmass of around $1 . 8 M _ { \odot }$ ,and growto dominate the parameter space for the most massive neutron stars.The non-monotonic dependence of the average mass number of the final abundances is also visible here.At higher masses,the wave stress contribution is able to drive strong r-processes even for very low neutrino and wave luminosities,where shock heating begins too late to strongly affect the nucleosynthesis.We have also run similar calculations with $Y _ { e , \mathrm { e q } } = 0 . 4 5$ .These show qualitatively similar behavior to the results shown in figure 12, except that the onset of wave stressdriven r-process nucleosynthesis is shifted to lower PNS mass.

In order to quantify the impact of the reduced electron fraction due to the wave stress contribution,we show in figure 13 the same parameter setas in figure 12,but with $Y _ { e }$ fixed to a constant value of 0.48.We find that includinga self-consistent $Y _ { e }$ evolution results inanoticeable broadening of the region in $L _ { \nu } – L _ { \nu } / L _ { w }$ space where ther-process occurs,especially the wave stress-dominated regime at lower $L _ { w }$ and $L _ { \nu }$ .This is perhaps to be expected,as the change in $Y _ { e }$ isdriven primarilyby the wave stress reducing the amount of neutrino heating needed to unbind the wind material.We also observe generally higher yields of r-process material when $Y _ { e }$ evolution is included,due to the higher number of free neutrons available.

Finally,in figure 14,we show the impact of instantaneous shock formation on nucleosynthesis across the entire parameter space (once again with $Y _ { e , \mathrm { e q } } = 0 . 4 8$ and $\omega = 2 { \times } 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { r a d } \mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ ,and self-consistently evolving $Y _ { e }$ ). In this case,we find third peak r-process production for nearlyall considered neutrino luminosities and PNS masseswhen $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu } \gtrsim 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ . Although the acceleration of the wind due to the wave stress plays a role in determining the nucleosynthesis in thesemodels,the impact of thewavesismainlydrivenbytheshock heatingthat theyprovide.

# 6CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the impact of gravito-acoustic waves launched by PNS convection on the dynamics and nucleosynthesis of the neutrino-driven wind. When these waves propagate through the NDW,they impose additional stresses on the wind and also may shock and provide an extra source of heating.Using steady-state, spherically symmetric models for the wind that include the impact of an acoustic wave energy flux, we surveyed the parameter space of thegravito-acoustic wave luminosity and frequency that is expected to be produced by PNS convection. The presence of shock heating in the wind precludes reliance upon the common predictive metric $s ^ { 3 } / \tau _ { d }$ ,as entropy is no longer nearly constant during seed formation.Therefore,using the results of our hydrodynamic models,we then performed calculations of nucleosynthesis for the marginally neutron-rich compositions that may be encountered in some NDWs.

For $L _ { w } \gtrsim 1 0 ^ { - 5 } L _ { \nu }$ ,thewaves strongly impact the dynamics of the wind via two mechanisms,acceleration due to wave stresses and entropy production via wave shock heating.Acceleration of the NDWbywave stresses reduces the dynamical timescale,but also reduces the entropyand electron fraction of thewind sincea faster wind has less opportunity to undergo neutrino heating. Depending on $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu }$ ,this competition between reduced dynamical timescale and reduced entropycan make conditions more orless favorable for strong r-process nucleosynthesis.

Similarly to previous work (Suzuki & Nagataki 20o5; Metzger etal.2Oo7),we find that if the wave energy is deposited (in our case through shock heating)before r-process seed nucleus formation begins,the entropy of the wind at seed formation is substantially increased.This in turn resultsinan alpha-rich freeze out and more favorable conditions for producing nuclei in the third r-process peak. Here,we found that the exact position of shock formation has a strong
