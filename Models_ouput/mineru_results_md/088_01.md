Rekha Raja

Abstract-Designing software architectures for autonomous robots foragricultural contexts isademanding and diffcult job due to the requirement to monitor numerous sensors and actuators,as well as autonomous decision-makingin unpredictable, unexpected scenarios.Depending on the essential requirements of a robotic device foragricultural usage,robot softwarearchitecture iscreated differently.Since no single software architecture exists forall applications,extensive knowledge of the various software architectures forrobots is needed when creating your own robotic architecture orselecting one from a number of existing architectures.Asa result,this article provides a comprehensive history of software architecture and its application in the agricultural domain along witha chronology of how software design has evolved over time. We provide several case studies to understand the importance of application of software architecture in agriculture and food industryand how to choose the best architecture for agricultural tasks. Finally,thisarticle discusses the open obstaclesand dificulties that mustbe addressed in order to ensure more advancements in the development of robot architecture foragricultural applications.

# I.INTRODUCTION

Een drobos e o emrimifsaf inttyt are increasingly spreading into new areas,such as home care, military operations,and rescue operations ([1]),driverless cars onroads,drones for inspection operations,underwater robots, robots for harvesting vegetables or fruits to space exploration. The agricultural sector, for example,has a huge demand for robots,which is expected to rise fromUSD4.6billion in 2020 to USD 20.3 billion by 2025 ([2]).The agricultural robots market is also growing due to a decline in the number of young farmers entering the agricultural sectorand an increase in labor minimum wages [3].Farmers are eagerly seekinga solution to this issue, with autonomous robots being one of the possibilities.

To construct autonomous robots that can be used in agricultural environments for a variety of tasks,such as harvest management (crops,vegetables,or fruits),field farming,crop management,higher levels of sophistication in perception,complex planningcapacity,effective control mechanisms,and increased learningcapability,are needed to adapt new environmentswith daunting challenges for the future.As a result,a thorough understanding of autonomous systems,their behavior,and the overall architecture of the system must be realized,and this remainsanimportant research subject.

One of our research objectives is to devise a methodology for programming that seamlessly integrates complex high-techtasks and to provide developerswith appropriate modelsto develop theirindividual software modules which will be part of the largesystem integration so that the code can be reusable and extendable.It is crystal clear that to designa robot architecture that involves complex functionality is required a great effort to work the whole system smoothly.However, due to the nonavailability of uniform standards in robotics, there is no commonly accepted robot architecture, especially for AI applications ([4]). This has led to researchers being forced to develop their own robotic software architectures.For that purpose,there exists alarge variety of robotic architecture.There are still scarce contributions regarding the global state of the art of different robot architectures suitable for agricultural applications.As the agricultural industry increasingly adopts automation and robotics to address its unique challenges,selecting the right software architectural pattern becomes a crucial decision that can significantly impact the success of projects.

This research article dives into the most popular software architectural patterns specifically tailored for agricultural robotics, exploring their benefits,drawbacks,selection criteria,and envisioning future perspectives.By critically analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each pattern, we aim to guide researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions when selecting the most suitable architectural pattern for their agricultural robotics applications. Through real-world case studies and scenariobased discussions,we highlighted the architectural patterns that align with the unique requirements and challenges encountered in tasks,such as harvesting,food processing,and packaging.We summarize the contribution of this article as follows.
