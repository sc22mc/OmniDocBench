results are anonymized and randomized as much as possible for a small group (5 practitioners in age from 25 to 50 yearswith meditation experience ranged from5 to 10 years） to remove bias.

# III.EXPERIMENTS

An overview of all attempts and their parameters is given in Table I.Experiments inthe phase 1a and 1b are fully reproducible in the selected group of meditators,we observe only avariation in intensity of temperature responses.We also observed a non-temperature response of surrounding electrochemical sensors on presence of meditators in all cases,however,detecting the exact begin and end of exercises,as shown in Fig.7,was possible only in several attempts. Since this topic represents the focus of other works [29],[33],[34], it was not pursued further here.Control measurements were carried out a) in parallel to experimental sessions on separate calorimeters (as non-targeted sensors);b) during so-called 'empty sessions’ (meditators were present but no sessions were conducted), several examples of control attempts are shown in Figs.10(a)- 10(c).

# A.Thephase1experiments

1a.Body temperature effects have been measured with three methods (IR,skin surface,core temperature)． The temperature data depends essentially on behavior of a meditator, even small changes in position (during a 2-3 hour experiment) disturb a thermodynamic equilibrium of the body and are reflected in an increasing or decreasing trend of $t$ Temperature dynamics depends on a fat content of tissues,clothing,room temperature and other factors that affect thermodynamic conditions.Therefore, experiments have been performed ina fixed position of a meditator,providing enough time for stabilizing body temperature before and after attempts.Fig.5 demonstrates several experiments with raising or lowering body temperature through meditative visualization in ASC.We observe analmost immediate response of body temperature to the visualization, thearea of persistent changes after the sessionis clearly visible; its duration is longer than the session itself.Inclination of temperature dynamics during the sessions is higher forregions of'natural’warm-up and cool-down phases,this indicates their more intensive thermodynamic mechanisms.Experiments on lowering body temperature does not include breading exercises.

1b.Additional attempts with heating up $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ waterin small containers have been undertaken to measure the heat produced by hands if focusing attention on one of the hands. Each containerhas one $t$ sensor immersed in the fluid and one $t$ sensor measuring air temperature outside the container. Without attention, hands produce almost equal amount of heat that results in a stable differential temperature of water and air sensors.Focusing attention on one hand increases its skin
