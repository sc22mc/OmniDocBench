Abstract-Insufficient availability of essential nutrients,such as iron,can impedeplant growth,decrease crop productivity,and even leadtoplant death.Thisiswhyitiscrucial to employproximal monitoring techniquesto detect early signs of nutrient stress and prevent yield loss.In this study,we continuously monitored the stemimpedance of eight tomato plants every hour for 38 days. This was done to observe the effects of iron stress by comparing these plants with those notunder stress.The normalized impedance magnitudeat $\mathbf { 1 0 \ k H z }$ revealsanoticeabledivergencein the trend of impedancemagnitude shortlyafter theremovalof ironfrom the nutrient solution,clearly indicating the effect of iron stress on plant bioimpedance.Additionally, the Cole equivalent circuit model was employed to evaluate the electrical parametersof the impedance spectra. The fitting results exhibit an average root-mean-square errorof $4 6 6 . 3 \Omega$ .Statistical analysis of the extracted circuit parameters shows significantdifferences between iron-stressed and control plants.Based on this hypothesis,the extracted circuit components have been used to train the machine learning classification model with several algorithms,to demonstrate that the multilayerperceptron isthe best performing model,yielding $98 \%$ accuracyand $91 \%$ and $89 \%$ precision in identifying early and late stress,respectively.This research demonstrates the effectiveness ofbioimpedance measurementsin tracking iron stress in plants. Our findings highlight the usefulness of impedance measurements formonitoring iron stress in plants and provide insights into the physiological responses of tomato plants to nutrient deprivationby observingchanges inbioimpedance circuit parameters over time.

# I.INTRODUCTION

T asreported by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Around $40 \%$ of harvested tomatoes are utilized in food processing,with Italyplayingamajorrole in this industry[1].Beinga model organism,tomato plants are highly regarded in the scientific community for their well-known advantageous traits. These include acompact,fully sequenced genome,arelatively short life cycle with straightforward cultivation methods,the feasibility of horticultural interventions,as well as the availability of a wide range of mutant lines,advanced genomics tools,and established protocols for conducting controlled environmental experiments with tomato plants [2].

Tomato plants are continuously interacting with their surrounding environment,which has both positive and negative influences,contributing to the plant stress with a wide spectrum ofabiotic and biotic stressors.Here,one of the maincauses of stress isnutrient starvation,to which the plantsrespond with aseries of well-studied physiological changes such as reduced photosynthetic activity and inadequate chlorophyll production leading to a clear impact on leaf greenness [3]. Among the most important nutrients for the plants correct physiological functioning,iron (Fe) plays an important role.In fact,despite its abundance in the soil, it results in an already low availability for the plant due to its low solubility[4].Iron is,indeed,an essential micronutrient for plants contributing to several vital processes, including chlorophyll development and function.When plants lack sufficient iron,they experience reduced photosynthetic activity,resulting in yellowing and interveinal chlorosis in young leaves [5],leading to yield losses of up to $30 \%$ [6].Such visible symptoms typically manifest several days or weeks after iron deprivation begins,varying with crop species,but typically when the plant is already in a late stress stage [5].For thisreason, tools allowing a precise characterization of the plant nutrient levelsand needs assume a crucial importance to early detect any stress and allow thus a timely intervention thereby leading to higher yields.In this context,different proximal monitoring methods have been describedin the literature[7], with increasing
