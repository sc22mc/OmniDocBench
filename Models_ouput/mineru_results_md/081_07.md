Other parameters in the wind models were fixed to $M _ { \mathrm { N S } } = 1 . 5 M _ { \odot }$ $L _ { \nu } = 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 2 } \mathrm { e r g ~ s } ^ { - 1 }$ ,and $\omega = 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { r a d s } ^ { - 1 }$ .The beginning of seed formation for each model is marked a square.

$\tau _ { d } { } ^ { 1 }$ .This can hinder or abet an alpha-rich freezeout depending on the relative strength of these two effects.After shock formation, $s$ is increased relative to the $L _ { w } = 0$ case,but potentially at temperatures thatare too low to impact the alpha-richness of theNDW.Therefore, to better understand the impact of gravito-acoustic wave heating on the wind, detailed nucleosynthesis calculations are required.

The radius at which the waves shock and the rate at which they damp will depend on their frequency content,with the shock formation radius approximately scaling as $\omega ^ { - 1 }$ (see equation 13) and the damping length $l _ { d } \propto \omega ^ { - 1 }$ fora fixed $L _ { w }$ .Therefore,larger wave frequencies will result in wave heating impacting the thermodynamic conditions of the NDW at smaller radii and higher temperatures.In figure 5,we show the impact of varying $\omega$ on the entropy of the wind. Clearly,larger $\omega$ resultsinahigher entropyat higher temperature, which ispotentiallymore favorable foranalpha-rich freezeout.The limiting case $\omega  \infty$ ï¼‰corresponds to instantaneous shock formation in the wind,but also implies a damping length that goes to zero. Nevertheless,we also show a case with fixed $\omega$ in $l _ { d }$ but assuming instantaneous shock formation,as this has been assumed in previous work looking at secondary heating mechanisms in the NDW (Suzuki & Nagataki 2005; Metzger et al. 2007). It is not clear what shock formation radii are favored,given the uncertainty in the range of frequencies excited by PNS convection and the approximate nature of equation 13.

# 5.2.2 Nucleosynthesis

Wenow present nucleosynthesis calculations based on the steadystate,gravito-acoustic wave-heated NDW models described in the previous section. Throughout,we assume $Y _ { e , \mathrm { e q } } = 0 . 4 8$ (unless otherwise noted),given that modelsof neutrino emission from PNSs suggest theNDW willat most bemarginally neutron rich.Note that for larger $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu }$ the actual value of $Y _ { e }$ at the beginning of nucleosynthesis can substantially differ from $Y _ { e , \mathrm { { e q } } }$ (see figure 4).

First,we consider the impact of varying $L _ { w } / L _ { \nu }$ fora fixed $\omega =$ $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mathrm { r a d \ s ^ { - 1 } }$ .The final abundances for NDW models with $M _ { \mathrm { N S } } =$ $1 . 5 M _ { \odot }$ and $L _ { \nu } = 3 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 2 }$ erg $\mathrm { s } ^ { - 1 }$ are shown in figure 6. These correspond to theNDWmodels shown in figure 4.Intheabsence of wave heating,this parameter set only undergoes an $\alpha$ -processthat terminates with a peak around mass 90 (Woosley & Hoffman 1992)
