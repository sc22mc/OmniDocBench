Remark 1. If $H$ is infinite-dimensional and $f$ isa bijective transformation of $\mathcal { G } ^ { k } ( H )$ preserving the ortho-adjacency in both directions,then $X \to f ( X ^ { \bot } ) ^ { \bot }$ is a bijective transformation of $\mathcal { G } _ { k } ( H )$ which also preserves the ortho-adjacency in both directions. If the latter transformation is induced by a unitary or anti-unitary operator $U$ ，then $f$ is also induced by $U$

The following example shows that the above statement fails for bijective transformations of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ preserving the ortho-adjacency relation in both directions. Let $U$ be a non-identity unitary operator on $H$ which preserves a certain connected component ${ \mathcal { C } } \subset { \mathcal { G } } _ { \infty } ( H )$ . Consider the bijective transformation $f$ of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ defined as follows: $f ( X ) = U ( X )$ if $X \in { \mathcal { C } }$ and $f ( X ) = X$ if $X \not \in { \mathcal { C } }$ .It is clear that $f$ is ortho-adjacency preserving in both directions.

Theorem 1. Let $f$ be a bijective transformation of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ which preserves the ortho-adjacency relationin both directions.Thenthe restriction of $f$ to every connected component of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ isinduced by a unitary or anti-unitary operator or it is the composition of the orthocomplementary map and a map induced by a unitary oranti-unitary operator.

The restrictions of $f$ to distinct connected components can be related to different operators.

# 3.A CHARACTERIZATION OF ADJACENCY IN TERMS OF ORTHO-ADJACENCY

If $X , Y \in \mathcal G _ { \infty } ( H )$ are not ortho-adjacent and there is $Z \in \mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ ortho-adjacent toboth $X , Y$ ,thenone of the followingpossibilitiesisrealized:

· $X , Y$ are adjacent; · $X \cap Y$ is of codimension 2 in both $X , Y$ ：

Indeed, $X \cap Z$ and $Y \cap Z$ are hyperplanes of $Z$ and $X , Y$ are adjacent if these hyperplanes coincide; the same holds if the hyperplanes are distinct and their intersection isa proper subspace of $X \cap Y$ ； we obtain the second possibility only when the hyperplanes are distinct and their intersection coincides with $X \cap Y$ ：

Lemma 1. Let $X , Y$ be compatible elements of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ whose intersection is of codimension 2 in both $X , Y$ .Then there is $Z \in \mathcal G _ { \infty } ( H )$ ortho-adjacent to both $X , Y$ . For every such $Z$ there are precisely two elements of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ ortho-adjacent to eachof $X , Y , Z$

Proof. The orthogonal sum of $X \cap Y$ ,a 1-dimensional subspace of $X \cap ( X \cap Y ) ^ { \perp }$ and a 1-dimensional subspace of $Y \cap ( X \cap Y ) ^ { \perp }$ is an element of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ ortho-adjacent toboth $X , Y$

Let $Z$ be an element of $\mathcal { G } _ { \infty } ( H )$ ortho-adjacent to both $X , Y$ .The subspaces $X , Y , Z$ are mutually compatible and there is an orthonormal basis $B$ of $H$ such that each of these subspaces is spanned by a subset of $B$ .Then $X \cap Y$ and the 2-dimensional subspaces

$$
X ^ { \prime } = X \cap ( X \cap Y ) ^ { \bot } , ~ Y ^ { \prime } = Y \cap ( X \cap Y ) ^ { \bot }
$$

are also spanned by subsets of $B$ .Furthermore, $X \cap Y$ is contained in $Z$ and

$$
P = Z \cap X ^ { \prime } , ~ Q = Z \cap Y ^ { \prime }
$$

are 1-dimensional.Let $P ^ { \prime }$ and $Q ^ { \prime }$ be the 1-dimensional subspaces which are the orthogonal complements of $P$ in $X ^ { \prime }$ and $Q$ in $Y ^ { \prime }$ ,respectively. Since each of the
