varies.The photon flux variation in the reflection component $( R _ { \mathrm { P ^ { - } } }$ $R _ { \mathrm { T } } )$ is roughly two times larger than that of the Compton component below ${ \sim } 1 0 \mathrm { k e V } .$ and becomesless than $1 / 2$ in the energy range above ${ \sim } 1 0 0 \mathrm { k e V } .$ We then plotted the ratio between the photon flux variation of the reflection and the Compton component between the peak phase and the trough phase,in order to show relative contributions from the Compton and the reflection component to the $\mathrm { X }$ -rayvariability withphoton energy.The QPO fractional RMS below ${ \sim } 1 0 \ \mathrm { k e V }$ is also larger than that above ${ \sim } 1 0 \mathrm { k e V }$ (see Figure 4), which suggests that strong variation of the QPO flux at lower energy band is due to the reflection component. Since the photon flux variation of the reflection component is determined by the variation of $n o r m \times \mathcal { R }$ ï¼Œ the dominated role of the reflection component below ${ \sim } 1 0 \ \mathrm { k e V }$ on the QPO flux variation can be understood as the parameter $\mathcal { R }$ of this observation islarge.

A remarkable result is shown in Figure 4. Starting from above $\sim 7 0$ $\mathrm { k e V } ,$ ,the flux variation between the peak phase and the trough phase isbecomingprimarily from the contribution of the direct Compton component.Beyond $1 0 0 \mathrm { k e V }$ or so,the contribution of the reflection component is negligible.This implies that detection of theLFQPOsat energyabove ${ \sim } 1 0 0 \mathrm { k e V }$ simply means that the Compton component itself produces the LFQPO quasi-periodicity,although the reflection component dominates the LFQPO peak-trough variation below $\sim 3 0$ $\mathrm { k e V . }$

# 3DISCUSSION

We have investigated the short-timescale X-ray spectra correspondingto the high and low intensity phases of the LFQPO (defined aspeak and trough) in one Insight-HXMT observation ofMAXI

$J 1 8 2 0 \substack { + 0 7 0 }$ .The greatest change among spectral parameters between the two LFQPO phases is the normalization norm.The difference in thenormalization represents the flux variation between the two phases in the primary Compton emission.Inthe energy range above ${ \sim } 1 0 0 \mathrm { k e V } .$ the Compton component overwhelmingly dominates over the reflection component,and thus the flux variation above $\mathord { \sim } 1 0 0$ between the peak and the trough phases is contributed by the Comptoncomponentalone (see Figure4).Therefore, the underlyingbeats that generate the LFQPOs should originate from the Compton emission.Under the framework of conventional Comptonization models, the Compton component is thought to originate from a hot corona. Our spectral analysis shows that the corona is not oscillating coronal temperature or electron density,since in our spectral fits,the temperature $k T _ { e }$ and $\tau$ of the Compton component does not show apparent changes between those of the peak and the trough phases. Thus the LFQPO corresponds to a modulation in the photon flux of the Compton component, either through modulation of the seed photons or line-of-sight covering factor.

The difference in the reflection fraction $\mathcal { R }$ between the peak and the trough phases demonstrates that the reflection fraction acts like an amplification factor of the variation in the primary incident Compton flux since the photon flux variation in the reflection component isdetermined by $n o r m \times \mathcal { R }$ .Thevalues of the reflection fraction in the peak and the trough phases are both very large (larger than unity) but different,which causes the flux change between the peak and the trough phasesat lower energies (below ${ \sim } 3 0 \mathrm { k e V } .$ ,see Figure 4) is dominated by the reflection component. The effect of the reflection fraction is also confirmed by that the fractional rms of the LFQPOs atbelow ${ \sim } 1 0 \mathrm { k e V }$ ishigher than that above $1 0 \ \mathrm { k e V } .$ In conclusion, the modulation in the Compton photons produces the underlying,
