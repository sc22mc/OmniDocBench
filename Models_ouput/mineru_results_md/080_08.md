Figure 5: Third step of encryption.

The third step involves adding transitions from $\Sigma$ to those states in $\boldsymbol { B }$ ,which haveundefined transitions for letters from $\Sigma$ .Inthatcaseweadd only $b$ letters. For example we defined $\rho ( 1 a , b ) = 2 b$ .Weshouldact similarly forallstates,for which $b$ is undefined, but we have only added some of the necessary transitions so thefigureisreadable.
