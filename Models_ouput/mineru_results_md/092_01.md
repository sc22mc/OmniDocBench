Abstract-Smart sensors used for intensive crop monitoring require minimal maintenance and should prioritize ecological sustainability.Consequently,battery-free energy harvesting representsa key aspect of sustainable development in smart agriculture.Plant microbial fuel cells (PMFCs) introduce a cutting-edge renewable energy source that scavenges energy from the symbiotic relationship between aplant and electron-generating bacteria in the soil,potentially supplying power as long as the plant lives. Characterizing PMFCs’power production is challenging,as it depends on many factors,such as soil impedance and plant condition. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is often used in laboratory tests,but it is inefficient to deploy inoff-grid contexts.This article introduces an ultralow power EIS biosensor architecture thatutilizes PMFCsas an energy source and for the EIS measure. We prove thatultralow-power EIS is compatible withPMFCs'mWlevel power production through an implementation that integrates anEIS analog frontend and PMFC-tailored harvesting electronics. The architecturealso facilitates PMFC unloading periods,crucial forPMFC recoveryand durability.Experimental resultsshowthat afull-rangeEIS sweep $( 2 1 . 3 ~ \mathrm { m H z - 2 1 . 8 ~ k H z } ,$ ,19 points）executed with the proposed architecture requires only $3 . 6 4 \mathbf { \delta J } .$ Wehighlight the potential of cost-effective,self-powered EIS inassisting PMFCs' development into reliable energy sources for battery-free nodes.We also demonstrate that plant state,as well as maximum power point could be monitored through ultralow power EISmeasurements.

# I.INTRODUCTION

wireless sensor networks to collect data on the crops and soil and then to control and optimize the use of resources, such aswater and pesticides.Thanks to the advancement of ultralow power computing paradigms and hardware [1],more environmentally friendly and maintenance-free supply solutions are gaining momentum,such as in battery-free electronics [2], [3].Typically,battery-free devices [4] harvest energy from the environment and store it in a supercapacitor, sporadically executing tasks [5]whenever energyis sufficient,inan intermittent fashion [6].

Aside from common energy harvesting sources,such as wind and solar power,plant microbial fuel cells (PMFCs） [7],[8] are sources of particular interest to the agricultural world. The simplest form of a PMFC consists of two conductive electrodes placed in the soil at a distance from one another and ofasuitable plant,placed right above the electrodes.PMFCs relyon the energy-producingmetabolism of naturally present exoelectrogenic bacteria and their symbiotic relationshipwith plants. These microorganisms release electrons as they consume organic matter (e.g.,glucose),which is continuously provided at the roots thanks to plant photosynthesis.The conductive electrodes placed in the soil support the formation of amicrobial biofilm,which catalyzes naturally occurring redox reactions in the soil, enabling energy production from the bacterial cell as longas theplant lives.

Although incredibly promising for their low environmental impact and maintenance costs,PMFC technology is still under development. These biofuel cells have several dependability issues that limit their widespread use and industrialization.We can articulate the nature of their shortcomings into three main points as follows.

$\textcircled{1}$ Low voltage, low power output: Single PMFCs output a voltage below 1 V and $\mathrm { \ m W / c m ^ { 3 } }$ powerdensities,meaning that efficient conversion electronics and/or output scaleup strategies are required for powering electronics from these sources.   
$\textcircled{2}$ Lowstability and predictability:PMFCsare verysensible to the surrounding environment and have unpredictable poweryields.They requirea startup phase ranging from days to weeks before they can source power and have a highly variable lifetime. Their voltage polarity output can also switch suddenlyand irreversiblyinwhatis termed voltage reversal (VR) [9].   
$\textcircled{3}$ Indirect fuel cell statemeasurement: Bacteria,plant,and electrode state,which are the most important factors in determining future power outputs,cannot be measured directly and nondestructively,as collecting samples from the cell would heavily alter itsstate.

A promising strategy to obtain voltage and power scaleup consists in connecting cells together in series/parallel [1O]. Unfortunately,the efficiency of this solution to $\textcircled{1}$ is limited by $\textcircled{2}$ ,asstacking is linked toa higher probabilityof VR[9].The cause of $\textcircled{2}$ must be sought in the complex electrobiochemical nature of PMFCs,whose understanding in real deployment scenariosis limited by the difficulties posedby fuel cell state
