Conjecture C. Let $p$ be an odd prime. If $\ell _ { 0 } \geq 3$ ,then there is a generator $g$ of $\mathbb { F } _ { p } ^ { \times }$ such that the diagonal equation

$$
g ^ { 2 } X ^ { \ell _ { 0 } } + g Y ^ { \ell _ { 0 } } + 1 = 0
$$

is solvable over $\mathbb { F } _ { p }$

The formulation in Conjecture $\boxed { \mathbf { C } }$ has the advantage that the number of $\mathbb { F } _ { p }$ -rational solutions to Equation $( 2 )$ can be computed in terms of certain character sums which have been well studied in number theory. By establishing valid cases in Conjecture $\mathbf { C } ,$ we also obtain the cases where Conjecture $\mathbf { \delta B }$ as well as Conjecture $\boxed { \mathrm { A } }$ are true. Therefore, by studying the solvability of Equation $\textcircled{2}$ over $\mathbb { F } _ { p }$ , we are able to provide new results to the construction of optimal CACs.

Motivated by Conjecture $\mathbb { C } ,$ instead of working on the diagonal equations as $\textcircled{2}$ over the prime field $\mathbb { F } _ { p }$ and the specific exponent $\ell _ { 0 }$ , we will look at general situations by taking the base field to be a finite extension of $\mathbb { F } _ { p }$ and the exponent in the equation is allowed to be more general than $\ell _ { 0 }$ .Let $q$ be a prime power and $\ell$ be a proper divisor of $q - 1$ .We consider the solvability of the following diagonal equation

$$
g ^ { 2 } X ^ { \ell } + g Y ^ { \ell } + 1 = 0
$$

ovr a finite fied $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ $q$ elements, where $g$ is a generatr of te mutiplicative group $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times }$ of $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ . In view of Conjecture $\bigtriangledown$ we're interested in whether or not there exists a generator $g$ such that Equation $\textcircled{3}$ has a $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ -rational solution. However,the answer can be false for divisors of $q - 1$ other than $\ell _ { 0 }$ . For example,in the case where $( q , \ell ) = ( 1 3 , 6 ) , ( 2 3 , 1 1 )$ there does not exist any generator of $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times }$ such that $\textcircled{3}$ has a $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ -rational solution.On the other hand, as a consequence of our main result below, Equation $( 3 )$ does have a $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ rational solution for some generator $g$ of $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times }$ provided that $q \geq 1 9$ $\ell = 6$ and $q \geq 3 2 2$ $\ell = 1 1$ . Our first main result is to give a lower bound for $q$ such that Equation $( 3 )$ has a $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ rational soltioforsomege $g$ dÃ¤ $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times }$

Theorem A( $\circleddash$ Theorem $\boxed { 4 . 3 }$ . Let q be a prime power and let $\ell$ be a proper divisor of $q - 1$ 1f

$$
q \geq ( 2 ^ { \omega ( \ell ) } ( \ell - 3 - \delta ) + 2 ) ^ { 2 } - 2
$$

where $\omega ( \ell )$ is the number of distinct prime divisors of $\ell$ and

$$
\delta = { \left\{ \begin{array} { l l } { 1 } & { i f 4 \mid \ell , } \\ { 0 } & { o t h e r w i s e , } \end{array} \right. }
$$

then there is a generator $g$ d $\mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times }$ such that Equation $\textcircled{3}$ is solvable over $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$

Remark 1.2. It follows from the Hasse-Weil bound (see Theorem $\boxed { 1 }$ that the number of $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ -rational solutions to Equation $( 3 )$ is bounded below by $q + 1 - 2 { \mathfrak { g } } _ { \ell } { \sqrt { q } }$ where ${ \mathfrak { g } } _ { \ell } = ( \ell -$ $1 ) ( \ell - 2 ) / 2$ is the genus of the curve defined by $( 3 )$ over $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ . As a result, Equation $( 3 )$ has a $\mathbb { F } _ { q }$ -rational solution for any $g \in \mathbb { F } _ { q } ^ { \times }$ provided that $q > ( \ell - 1 ) ^ { 2 } ( \ell - 2 ) ^ { 2 }$ . It is reasonable to expect that this lower bound can be improved under the weaker condition given in
