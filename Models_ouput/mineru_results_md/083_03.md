check that the results converge [18]. This serves as verification of the method and a baseline that allows us to evaluate the thermal effectsofthe plasma.

FIG.1. A construction of the energy-resolved fusion probability fora $^ { 1 6 }$ O projectile and $^ \mathrm { 1 8 8 }$ Ostargetwith coupled channels but without a plasma environment ( $\tau = 0$ MeV). Gaussian and Coulomb wave packets are used,taking the average energy-resolved fusion probability fora range of incident mean energies, $E _ { 0 }$ .Error bars due to statistical error are included but most are insignificant.The nominal Coulomb barrierbetween thesenucleiis 71.7 MeV.

Fig.2 shows the population of the radial grid basis states over time foraninitial Gaussian wave packetwith anaverageenergy $E _ { 0 } = 7 0$ MeVandatemperature $\mathcal { T } =$ 0.1 MeV.The change of population of both the ground state(elastic channel） and the $2 ^ { + }$ excited state of $^ \mathrm { 1 8 8 }$ Os (inelastic channel) due to both thermal effects and the radial coupling between these states can be observed.

To isolate the effects of temperature on fusion probability,the increase in energy-resolved fusion probability wascalculated using the ratio between coupled channels calculations at either $\tau = 0 . 1$ MeVor $\tau = 0 . 5$ MeV and $\tau = 0$ MeV,shown in Fig.3. The fusion probability was calculated by taking the average energy-resolved fusion probability for initial wave packets with varying $E _ { 0 }$ For $\tau = 0 . 1$ MeV,the green (square） pointswere calculated using a Gaussian wave packet with $E _ { 0 } = 6 0 $ ， 63,65,67 and 70 MeV,and theblue (circle) points were calculated using a Coulomb wave packet with $E _ { 0 } = 6 5$ ， 67 and 7O MeV.The same method wasused for both $\tau = 0$ and $\tau = 0 . 5$ MeV.Theerrorbarsassociated with thesepoints are simply due to the standard error in the mean.We usea Gaussian wave packet for itsaccuracy at deep sub-barrier energies compared to a Coulomb wave packet.However,a Coulomb wave packet offers a better global description of fusion probability around and above
