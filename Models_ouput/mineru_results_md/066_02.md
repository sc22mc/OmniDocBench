Fig.2:Basic decomposition scheme of the CA-WL for $i _ { \mathrm { m a x } } { = } 3$ decomposition levels resulting in one BL and three ELs.Depending on the underlying motion in the original sequence,the local depth of the decomposition differs.

box in Fig. In the first step,splittingis performed by decomposing the input signal into even-and odd-indexed frames $l _ { 2 t }$ and $l _ { 2 t - 1 }$ .In the second step,the even frames are predicted from the odd framesby aprediction operator $\mathcal { P }$ .Subtracting the predicted values $\mathcal { P } ( l _ { 2 t - 1 } )$ from the even frames,results in theHP coefficients $h _ { 2 t }$ .Inthe third step,theHPcoefficientsarefilteredbyanupdate operator $\mathcal { U }$ and areadded back to the odd frames,resulting in the LP coefficients. To get coarser temporal resolutions,the lifting scheme can be iterated on the LP subband by $i _ { \mathrm { m a x } } = \log _ { 2 } ( T )$ decomposition levels,where $T$ equals the total number of original frames.

Sincethe liftingstructure offersa flexible framework,it can be modified in multiple ways.By introducing rounding operators as introduced in $\textcircled { 8 }$ ,integerto integer transformscan beachieved,which yield perfect reconstruction. This makes the lifting structure of the WThighly attractive for many professional applicationsby offeringascalable representation and lossless reconstruction at the same time.However, due to temporal displacements in the sequence,blurriness and ghosting artifactswill appear in theLP subband.These can be alleviated by incorporating MC methods directly into the liftingstructure without losing the property of perfect reconstruction. This is called motion compensated temporal filtering (MCTF) 9 and can be achieved by realizing the prediction operator $\mathcal { P }$ bythe warping operator $\mathcal { W } _ { 2 t - 1  2 t }$ .Insteadof theoriginal odd frames,a compensated version is subtracted from the even frames.In case of the Haar wavelet filters,the prediction step is given by

$$
h _ { 2 t } = l _ { 2 t } - \lfloor \mathcal { W } _ { 2 t - 1  2 t } \mathopen { } \mathclose \bgroup ( l _ { 2 t - 1 } \aftergroup \egroup ) \mathclose \bgroup \egroup \big \rfloor .
$$

However, to achieve an equivalent wavelet transform,the compensation has to be inverted in the update step $\pm$ .By reversing the index of $\mathcal { W }$ ,theLP coefficients of the Haar transform can be calculated by

$$
l _ { 2 t - 1 } = l _ { 2 t - 1 } + \lfloor \frac 1 2 \mathcal { W } _ { 2 t  2 t - 1 } ( h _ { 2 t } ) \rfloor .
$$

$\mathcal { W }$ can be realized by different approaches of MC.In this work,we will employa block-based approach.

# 3.CONTENTADAPTIVEWAVELETLIFTING

Considering video sequences from surveillance systems or medical data sets,which comprise a temporal acquisition of images with contrast medium, there will be parts,where almost no motion occurs over time.In this case,an adaptive temporal scaling is advantageous,which performs iterativelya further decomposition,if subsequent frames are similar enough. If there are no changes over several frames,they shall berepresentedbyonlyoneLP frame.For significant changes among subsequent frames,for example when the contrast medium gets visible,these changes shall be represented in the LP subband with finer temporal resolution.

Fig.2shows the basic approach of our proposed content adaptive wavelet transform. Index $i$ indicates the number of the current decomposition level. For $i { = } 0$ ,no decomposition has been done so far, which corresponds to the original video sequence.In the first row,a schematic video sequence is given,which consists of three sections, each with a different amount of moving content. The correspondingamount of motion is described by the legend on the right side ofFig2 While in this example the first decomposition is performed for the entire sequence,the second decomposition is performed only on the frames with no or low motion. The third decomposition is exclusively done on frames with no motion. The resulting BL and ELsare marked at the right side.Since the maximum decomposition level $i _ { \mathrm { m a x } }$ is equal to 3, three ELsare generated.By combining the ELs with the BL at the decoder side,the original sequence can be reconstructed step by step without any loss.

# 3.1.Calculation of the Stopping Criterion

Haar WTs can be represented with tree structures $\textcircled { 4 }$ .For3-D SBC, the tree structure is given by decomposing two subsequent frames into LPand HP frames.To realize the CA-WL,the costs of the single nodesinevery tree have to be considered. If the combined costsof the child nodes exceed the costs of the parent node,this means for anarbitrarysignal $s$ ,if

$$
\mathcal { C } ( s _ { i , [ 2 t - 1 , 2 t ] } ) \leq ( \mathcal { C } ( s _ { i + 1 , 2 t - 1 } ) \cup \mathcal { C } ( s _ { i + 1 , 2 t } ) )
$$

holds,then the child nodes shallbe pruned from the tree.Here, $\mathcal { C } ( \cdot )$ describes a cost functional,which represents the coding costs,such asentropy $\pmb { \mathbb { 1 1 } }$ or rate-distortion $\lVert 1 2 \rVert$ In this work,every decomposition level is performed for the entire input sequence in advance, before a retrospective evaluation of the resulting costs is done.Further,we decided to usearate-distortion-based approach forcalculating the coding costs.Therefore,we formulate theLagrangian cost
