Figure1:Estimated growth rates as afunction of time for SEIR-models.The gray horizontal ribbons are the largest eigenvalue of the different generator matrices,see Equation $( 3 )$ ,andthe red andblueribbons converging to them are the observed growth rates,i.e.a linear least squares fit to $\textstyle \sum _ { j } I _ { j }$ on log scale to either the 10 ( $[ - 4 , 5 ]$ ,redï¼‰or 20( $\lfloor - 9 , 1 0 \rfloor$ ,blue) surrounding days.The growth rate is associated with the middleof the interval rather than theend toalignwith theoreticalvalues.The striped vertical band indicates the $1 0 \%$ -point of $\mathrm { m a x } _ { j > 1 } \exp \left[ ( \mathrm { R e } ( r _ { j } ) - r _ { 1 } ) t \right]$ corresponding to $\ln ( 1 0 ) \tau$ toillustrate the time scalesetbyEquation $\textcircled { 6 }$ .The rows are initialization of the outbreak in different age groups,and the columns are normalization of the largest eigenvalue to match the infectiousness of either the Omicron variant in December 2021or Delta variant in June 2021 in Denmark $\boxed { 1 3 }$
