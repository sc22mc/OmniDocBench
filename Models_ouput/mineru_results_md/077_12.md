Hence $p$ is translation equivariant even if $q$ isnot.

# A.3. Chirality

In addition to the symmetries described in Section 4.1 the potential energy $U ( x ^ { p } )$ of a molecular configuration is also invariantunder mirroring.However,inthe presenceofchiralitycenters,amirroredconfiguration is non-superposable to its originalimage(Kelvin,894).AnexampleofachiralitycenterinanaminoacidisaCarbonatomconnectedtofour different groups, e.g. a $C _ { \alpha }$ atom. In nature most amino acids come in one form, namely L-amino acids. Hence, all our datasets consistofpeptides containing onlyL-aminoacids.Inrarecases,as the modelproposeslarge steps,one stepmight change oneL-aminoacidofapeptide toaD-aminoacid ina way that theresultingconfigurationhasalowenergyand the stepwouldbeaccepted.We preventthis bychecking allchiralitycenters forchangesateach stepandrejectsamples where such a change occurs. This does not add any significant computational overhead.

# B.1.2AA additional results

More examples fromthe2AA test set are presented in Figures 8and9.We achieve the worst speed-upfor the dipeptide GP（Figure8last row）as it does not showanyslow transitions.The distributionof the aceptance probabilities for the Timewarp MCMC algorithm is shown in Figure 7

More examples fromthe 4AA testsetare presented inFigures 10and12.The distributionof theacceptance probabilities for the Timewarp MCMC algorithm is shown in Figure 7.

# B.3. Conditional distributions

The model was trained to generate samples from the conditional Boltzmann distribution $\mu ( x ( t + \tau ) | x ( t ) )$ . Here we show someexamplesof theconditional distribution generatedbythe Timewarp modelcompared totheconditional distribution inducedbyMD.Whilewecangenerate5,OOOsamplesfromtheconditionaldistributionofthe model inparalel,weequire 5, 000 distinct MD trajectories of simulation length $\tau$ to sample the conditional distribution with MD.
