# ABSTRACT

X-raylow frequencyquasi-periodicoscilations (LFQPOs)ofblack holeX-raybinaries,especiallythose type-CLFQPOs,are representative timing signal ofblack hole low/hard stateand intermediate state,which has been suspected as tooriginate due toLense-Thiringprecessionoftheaccretionfow.HerewereportananalysisofoneoftheInsight-HXMTobservationsof the black hole transient MAXI $\mathrm { J } 1 8 2 0 \mathrm { + } 0 7 0$ taken near the flux peak of its hard spectral state during which strong type-C LFQPOs were detected in all three instruments up to photon energies above $1 5 0 \mathrm { k e V } .$ Weobtained and analyzed the short-timescale X-ray spectracorresponding tohigh-andlow-intensitypases oftheobservedLFQPO waveform withaspectral modelcomposedof Comptonizationanddiskreflectioncomponents.Wefoundthatthenormalizationofthespectralmodelis theprimaryparameter that varied between the low and high-intensity phases.The variation in the LFQPO flux at the hard X-ray band $( \gtrsim 1 0 0 \mathrm { k e V } )$ is from the Compton component alone,while theenergy dependent variation in the LFQPO flux at lower energies $( \lesssim 3 0 \mathrm { k e V } )$ is mainlycaused bythereflectioncomponentwithalargereflectionfractioninresponsetotheincident Comptoncomponent. Theobserved X-rayLFQPOsthusshouldbeunderstoodas manifestingtheoriginal timingsignals orbeats inthe hardCompton component, which gives rise to additional variability in softer energies due to disk reflection.

# 1INTRODUCTION

Mostof black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) inour galaxy are transient sources.They occasionally experienced an outburst and spent most of their time in quiescence.During an outburst, the Xrayspectral and timing propertiesusually changes dramatically on atimescale of days to months (Miyamoto et al.1995;Remillard & McClintock 2006; Done et al. 2007; Belloni & Motta 2016). So different spectral states are classified based on the X-ray spectral and timing properties.The two main spectral states are hard and soft states.The accretion flow in the soft state is thought to be the geometrically thin disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973),which is characterised bythe multi-temperature black body X-ray spectrum and very low level short term X-ray variability.TheX-ray spectra of the hard state aredominated by the inverse Comptonization scattering of the hot corona.Apartof thehard X-ray illuminatestheaccretiondisk and then produces a reflection component,which is characterised by the fluorescent iron $\mathrm { K } \alpha$ line and the reflection hump at $\sim 3 0 \ \mathrm { k e V }$ (e.g. Fabian & Ross 2O1O,,for a review).During the hard state,theX-ray variabilityamplitude is very high,and low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) are usually detected.

One of the most common type low-frequency QPO for BH XRBs is called type-C QPO,the central frequency of which may evolve in the tensof $\mathrm { m H z }$ to $3 0 \ \mathrm { H z }$ range,depending on its spectral state(Psaltis et al.1999; Casella et al. 2004; Van der Klis 2006). The type-C

QPO generally appearsas very strongand narrow peaks in the power spectrum.The origin of type-C QPO is still under debate,and a popular model is the Lense-Thirring precession of the hot flow(see reviews by Ingram & Motta 2019).

Besides conventional timing and spectral analysis of the QPO properties, phase-resolved timing and spectral analysis can provide timing and spectral information of the QPO at different phases,revealing the origin ofQPOs(Yu etal.20O1;Yu & van der Klis 2002). Specifically for the LFQPOs in black hole binaries,Miller& Homan (2004) detected variation of the Fe $\mathrm { K } \alpha$ line with QPO phase which suggests that the QPOs originate in the inner disk.Ingram& van der Klis (2015) observed modulation of theFe $\mathrm { K } \alpha$ line width and reflection component by reconstructing the GRS $1 9 1 5 \substack { + 1 0 5 }$ energy spectrum at different phases,providing evidence for a geometric origin of the X-ray QPO.Later on,more comprehensive analysis of theLFQPOs has been performed with the observations of H1743- 322 (Ingram et al.2016,2017).Both the iron line energy and the reflection fraction are found modulated with the QPO phase. This is taken as strong evidence supporting the Lense-Thirring precession model.In recent analysis about QPO phase-resolved spectroscopy, Nathan et al. (2O22) detected a significant modulation of the reflection fraction in GRS $1 9 1 5 \substack { + 1 0 5 }$ ,which indicates that the inner accretion disk geometrychangeswith QPO phase.

MAXIJ $1 8 2 0 \substack { + 0 7 0 }$ is one of the brightest transient black hole X-ray binaries,which isdiscovered inX-ray on2018March11byMonitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI; Kawamuro et al. 2018; Tucker et al.2O18). The X-ray intensity of the source increased rapidly and
