to $1 . 0 6 \%$ in total average,while the visual quality is increased by $1 0 . 2 8 \mathrm { d B }$ ,as the right column of Table2shows.

To demonstrate the performance of our proposed CA-WL in more detail, Fig.Bpresents the absolute rate and $\mathrm { P S N R } _ { \mathrm { L P } _ { t } }$ results fromthe AirportNight1 sequencewithandwithoutMC,using $\lambda { = } 3$ As the left plot offers,the entire file size for incorporating MC is always higher than omitting MC.However,the visual quality is significantly higher by includingMC,which is very important for many professional applications.But for higher decomposition levels $i$ theerror propagation due to imperfect MC is increasing. The right plot shows the strong decreasing $\mathrm { P S N R } _ { \mathrm { L P } _ { t } }$ results,which can be prevented by our proposed CA-WL. Simultaneously,the overall file size canbe decreased, asthe left plot of Fig.Bshows.

In Fig.4 some visual results for each data set are presented. From left to right,the reference frame and the corresponding LP frames from the U-WL and the proposed CA-WL are shown fora value of $\lambda { = } 3$ ï¼Œwithout MC and with block-based MC,respectively. Disturbing artifacts and loss of content,resulting from the U-WL, arehighlighted in every frame.The rectanglesdepict blockingartifacts,the circles indicate locations of objects,which are canceled out completely,and the ellipses showblurring artifacts.As the right column shows,the CA-WL is capable to compensate this lack of data fidelity efficiently and gives areliable impression of the actual content of the sequence. This is also proven by the PSNR values given at the bottom right corner of each frame.

# 5.CONCLUSION

Scalable lossless video coding and a high visual quality of the corresponding BL is very important for many professional applications. Wavelet-based video coding provides full scalability without additional overhead. The temporal resolution can be controlled by the recursive application of theWTin temporal direction to theLP subband of the previous stage.This leads to lower bit rates,but if the content of the underlying video sequence comprises strong motion, the visual quality of the BL is degraded significantly.We proposed amethod which locally adapts the temporal scalingby evaluatinga Lagrangian cost functional in every transformation step and prevents further decomposition,if the costs of the current level are higher than the costs of the previous level. This way,we can increase the visual quality of theBLby $1 0 . 2 8 \mathrm { d B }$ compared to the U-WL with blockbased MC,while the required rate is reduced by $1 . 0 6 \%$ at the same time.Further work aimsat the development of an algorithm to determine the optimum value of $\lambda$ ina rate-distortion sense,based on the characteristics of the underlying sequence.
