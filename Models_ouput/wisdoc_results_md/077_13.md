Timewarp: Transferable Acceleration of Molecular Dynamics by Learning Time-Coarsened Dynamics

Figure 8. Experiments on 2AA test dipeptides QW (top row), HT (middle row) and GP (bottom row). Comparison of the long MD trajectory and Timewarp MCMC (Algorithm 1). (a) TICA plots. (b) Free energy comparison of the first two TICA components. (c) Autocorrelation for the TIC 0 component. (d) Time dependence of the TIC 0 component.
