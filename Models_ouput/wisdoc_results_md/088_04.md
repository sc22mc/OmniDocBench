development of robotic systemswith human-like cognitive abili- ties, such as perception, reasoning, and learning. Examples, sub- sumption architecture [6] is a control architecture that empha- sizes reactive behavior and task decomposition. It is composed of multiple layers, each of which is responsible for a different task or behavior. Higher layers can suppress the output of lower layers, allowing the robot to perform complex behaviors in a modular fashion; ACT-R architecture is a cognitive architecture that emphasizes decision-making, planning, and goal-directed behavior. It is based on the idea of production systems, which are rules that specify a condition–action pair. ACT-R models human cognition and is often used to predict human behavior in various tasks.

2) Reactive Architecture Versus Deliberative Architecture: Reactive architecture [7] focuses on the development of robotic systems that can quickly and appropriately respond to changes in the environment or stimuli, while deliberative architecture focuses on the development of robotic systems that can plan and reason about their actions and goals. Example, behavior Tree architecture is a reactive architecture that emphasizes task decomposition and decision-making. It is composed of a tree structure, where each node represents a task or behavior. The tree is executed in a top-down manner, allowing the robot to make decisions based on the current state of the environment; goal-oriented action planning is a deliberative architecture that emphasizes planning and goal-directed behavior. It is based on the idea of a plan library, which is a set of predefined plans that can be used to achieve specific goals. The robot selects the appropriate plan based on the current goal and the state of the environment.

3) Layered Architecture Versus Hybrid Architecture: Lay- ered architecture [8] organizes the robotic system into distinct layers that provide different levels of abstraction and function- ality, while hybrid architecture combines elements of different architectures to achieve specific goals or requirements. Exam- ple, model-view-controller (MVC) architecture [9], [10] is a layered architecture that separates the user interface (view), application logic (controller), and data (model) into separate components. This separation allows for greater modularity and flexibility, making it easier to modify or replace individual components; service-oriented architecture is a hybrid architec- ture that combines elements of both centralized and distributed architectures. It is based on the idea of services, which are self-contained, modular components that can be accessed re- motely. Services can be combined in different ways to cre- ate complex systems, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements.

4) Sense–Plan–Act Architecture Versus Behavior-Based Ar- chitecture: Sense–plan–act architecture [11] divides the robotic system into three stages: sensing the environment, planning a course of action, and executing the plan, while behavior-based architecture focuses on the development of autonomous agents that can perform tasks through the interaction of simple be- haviors. Example, hybrid deliberative/reactive architecture is a sense–plan–act architecture that combines elements of both deliberative and reactive architectures. It is composed of mul- tiple layers, each of which is responsible for a different task or behavior. Higher layers can suppress the output of lower layers, allowing the robot to perform complex behaviors in a modular fashion; subsumption architecture (behavior-based architecture) is a behavior-based architecture that emphasizes reactive behavior and task decomposition. It is composed of multiple layers, each of which is responsible for a different task or behavior. Higher layers can suppress the output of lower
