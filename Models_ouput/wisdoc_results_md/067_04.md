We obtain the following final decomposition of the EUR PnL into four parts:

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}&{P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}=\frac{A_{t}+A_{T}}{2}\left(\chi_{T}-\chi_{t}\right)}&{=:P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(\chi))}\\ &{+\displaystyle\frac{\chi_{t}+\chi_{T}}{2}\left(\frac{A_{T}(r_{T},x_{T})-A_{T}(r_{t},x_{T})}{2}+\frac{A_{t}(r_{T},x_{t})-A_{t}(r_{t},x_{t})}{2}\right)}&{(:=P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(r))}\\ &{+\displaystyle\frac{\chi_{t}+\chi_{T}}{2}\left(\frac{A_{T}(r_{T},x_{T})-A_{T}(r_{T},x_{t})}{2}+\frac{A_{t}(r_{t},x_{T})-A_{t}(r_{t},x_{t})}{2}\right)}&{(:=P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(x))}\\ &{+\displaystyle\frac{\chi_{t}+\chi_{T}}{2}\left(\frac{A_{T}(r_{T},x_{t})-A_{t}(r_{T},x_{t})}{2}+\frac{A_{T}(r_{t},x_{T})-A_{t}(r_{t},x_{T})}{2}\right).}&{=:P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(\mathrm{carry}))}\end{array}
$$

(A) The interpretation of P is the following: at an arbitrary time point u the difference (t,T ](r)

Au(rT , xu) − Au(rt, xu) measures the PnL of the market price at that time that would (A) be induced by a discounting curve change from rt to rT . The PnL P is defined (t,T ](r)

as the arithmetic mean of this difference for the two time points u = t and u = T . (A) The precisely same logic applies to the interpretation of P only with r replaced (t,T ](x), (A) by x. Finally, the PnL P intuitively should measure the change between the (t,T ](carry)

asset values At and AT that is only due to time passing, without the effects of r and x. Since the variables r and x change their values within the period (t, T ], one reasonable approach is to use an “average” of the variables r, x on the period (t, T ]. Since we only have r, x available at the two time points t and T , a pragmatic idea to accomplish such average is to mix the possible pairs (ru, xs) for u, s ∈ {t, T} in a way that is as “neutral” (A) as possible. This is precisely what’s done in the definition of P (t,T ](carry).

Remark 2.1 (On the approximative nature of our definitions)

(A) (A)

Similar as in Remark 1.1, we point out that our definition of P and P (t,T ](r) (t,T ](x) in terms of an arithmetic average of start and end time point values is only a proxy to reality. Clearly, an average that would take into account all time points u ∈ (t, T ] would be more desirable from a theoretical perspective. For instance, based on the multivariate Itô formula, under the assumption that {ru}u∈(t,T and {xu}u∈(t,T are re- alizations of semi-martingales, take values in R (i.e. are not function-valued), and under the assumption that r and x are independent, we obtain the decomposition (∫

$$
\begin{array}{rl}&{A_{T}-A_{t}=\Big(\displaystyle\int_{(t,T]}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}A_{u}(r_{u},x_{u})\,\mathrm{d}u\Big)}\\ &{\qquad\qquad+\Big(\displaystyle\int_{(t,T]}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}A_{s}(r_{u},x_{u})\,\mathrm{d}r_{u}+\frac{1}{2}\,\int_{(t,T]}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial r^{2}}A_{s}(r_{u},x_{u})\,\mathrm{d}[r,r]_{u}\Big)}\\ &{\qquad\qquad+\Big(\displaystyle\int_{(t,T]}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}A_{s}(r_{u},x_{u})\,\mathrm{d}x_{u}+\frac{1}{2}\,\int_{(t,T]}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}A_{s}(r_{u},x_{u})\,\mathrm{d}[x,x]_{u}\Big),}\end{array}
$$

and the three terms in (.)-brackets could be interpreted as performance due to carry, changes in r, and changes in x, respectively. While already this formula is difficult to implement in practice, we point out that typically ru is a function (an interest rate term structure), so that a generalization in this regard requires significantly more advanced stochastic integration techniques. Furthermore, the assumption of dependence between r and x induces additional quadratic co-variation terms to the last formula that must be dealt with, similar to the situation mentioned in Remark 1.1 when A and χ have common jumps. While such more theoretical considerations lie beyond the scope of this more practically oriented article, we still find it important to highlight this issue, as it makes clear that our definition is only an approximation to reality.
