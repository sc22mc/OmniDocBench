Figure 6: Fourth step of encryption.

The last step involves adding some number of transitions under letters from the alphabet {0, 1} between states belonging to the same copy of a public key in B. In that case we have added transition ρ(9a, 0) = 10a (first copy), transitions ρ(7b, 1) = 10b and ρ(8b, 1) = 3b (second copy) and transition ρ(12c, 0) = 7c (third copy).

4 Basic decryption

For that section we assume that we have a ciphertext automaton B = (P,Σ, ρ) constructed from a public key A = (Q,Σ, δ), and that we know a private key w which is a carefully synchronizing word for the automaton A. First we state a lemma.

Lemma 1. Let Q.w = ql. After removing letters x ∈ {0, 1} from automaton B |u|+1 2 we have that P.w = {q1l , q , .., q }. l l
