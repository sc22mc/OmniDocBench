Abstract—Ginger (Zingiber officinale), a globally cultivated spice crop, is vital to numerous economies. However, its production faces significant challenges due to pests and diseases, which can lead to substantial yield losses. Traditional methods for detecting these threats often rely on visual inspection by human experts, a pro- cess that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. This article examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to address these limitations and transform ginger cultivation. It provides a comprehensive analysis of conventional pest and disease management strategies, identifying their short comings and explor- ing the potential of emerging AI technologies, including the AI of things’ applications, for accurate, efficient, and timely detection and control. By pinpointing the challenges and outlining promising avenues for future research, this study aims to equip agriculturists and researchers with the knowledge necessary to optimize ginger production, enhance food security, and foster sustainable farming practices.

Index Terms—Artificial intelligence (AI), artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), disease detection, ginger, Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), precision agriculture, sustainable agriculture.

I. INTRODUCTION

INGER, a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to theZingiberaceae family, is cultivated globally for its ver- satile rhizomes, used in culinary, medicinal, and aromatic ap- plications [1], [2]. The leading producers of ginger include In- dia, China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Thailand, Jamaica, Bangladesh, Nepal, Cameron, and Japan [3], [4]. Despite its economic sig- nificance, ginger production faces numerous challenges, with diseases posing a substantial threat to yield and quality. These diseases, caused by fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes, can significantly reduce yield and quality.

InAugust 2023, a devastating fungal epidemic ravaged ginger crops in Kaduna State, Nigeria, wiping out approximately 95%

of the region’s production. The disease, characterized by sudden yellowing and drying of leaves, ultimately led to the rotting of ginger rhizomes in the soil [5]. An assessment conducted by the Institute of Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, identified the disease as a fungal infection, which is both air and soilborne. Similar disease outbreaks have been reported in other ginger-producing countries, including bacterial wilt in Kochi Prefecture, Japan [6], Ethiopia [7], Queensland, Australia [8], andChina [8]. Early detection andprediction could have prevented this immense economic loss. These incidents highlight the global nature of ginger diseases and underscore the urgent need for effective disease management strategies to protect ginger crops worldwide. Unfortunately, traditional human-based methods for visually monitoring ginger plants can be inefficient due to factors, such as weather conditions, workload, fatigue, and human error [9], [10]. Furthermore, the use of human experts can be costly for small farmers, time-consuming, and a very tedious task [10]. Hence, the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the use of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) tools for plant disease detection have become an active research area.

The use ofAI for disease detection, classification, and diagno- sis in plants has been largely studied in the literature [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Some of the examples of plants inwhichAI has been applied for disease detection include cassava [18], groundnut (peanut) [20], apple, cherry, corn, grape, orange, peach, strawberry, tomato [19], chili [21], watermelon [22], maize [23], tomato and potato plants [24], cotton plants [25], citrus plant [26], wheat [27], banana [28], almond [29], and ginger [9], [30]. By harnessing the power of AI, IoT, and AIoT, farmers and agricultural scientists can proactively identify and address potential disease outbreaks, ultimately improving crop yields and securing food supplies. Existing literature has provided insight into the diseases affecting ginger detection of diseases and pests in ginger, and prevention techniques [31], [32], [33], [34]. However, there is still a need for a comprehen- sive review of works on diseases, management, and the use of the latest technologies, such as IoT, AI, and AIoT for disease detection in ginger plants.

The article aims to provide an overview of the techniques and state-of-the-art technologies employed in detecting pests and plant diseases in ginger plants. Accordingly, the contributions of this article are as follows.

1) An overview of the basic pests and diseases that affect ginger plants, symptoms, and causes is discussed.
