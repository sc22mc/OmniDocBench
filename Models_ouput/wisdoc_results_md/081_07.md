Figure 4. Radial profiles of the velocity, density, temperature, and entropy in the NDW. Different lines correspond to different 𝐿𝑤 . Other parameters in the wind models were fixed to 𝑀NS = 1.5𝑀 , 𝐿𝜈 = 3 × 1052 erg s−1, and 𝜔 = 2 × 103 rad s−1. The beginning of seed formation for each model is marked a square.

1. This can hinder or abet an alpha-rich freezeout depending on 𝜏𝑑

the relative strength of these two effects. After shock formation, 𝑠 is increased relative to the 𝐿𝑤 = 0 case, but potentially at temperatures that are too low to impact the alpha-richness of the NDW. Therefore, to better understand the impact of gravito-acoustic wave heating on the wind, detailed nucleosynthesis calculations are required.

The radius at which the waves shock and the rate at which they damp will depend on their frequency content, with the shock for- mation radius approximately scaling as 𝜔−1 (see equation 13) and the damping length 𝑙𝑑 ∝ 𝜔−1 for a fixed 𝐿𝑤 . Therefore, larger wave frequencies will result in wave heating impacting the thermodynamic conditions of the NDW at smaller radii and higher temperatures. In figure 5, we show the impact of varying𝜔 on the entropy of the wind. Clearly, larger 𝜔 results in a higher entropy at higher temperature, which is potentially more favorable for an alpha-rich freezeout. The limiting case (𝜔 → ∞) corresponds to instantaneous shock forma- tion in the wind, but also implies a damping length that goes to zero. Nevertheless, we also show a case with fixed 𝜔 in 𝑙𝑑 but assuming

instantaneous shock formation, as this has been assumed in previous work looking at secondary heating mechanisms in the NDW (Suzuki & Nagataki 2005; Metzger et al. 2007). It is not clear what shock formation radii are favored, given the uncertainty in the range of frequencies excited by PNS convection and the approximate nature of equation 13.

5.2.2 Nucleosynthesis

We now present nucleosynthesis calculations based on the steady- state, gravito-acoustic wave-heated NDW models described in the previous section. Throughout, we assume 𝑌𝑒,eq = 0.48 (unless oth- erwise noted), given that models of neutrino emission from PNSs suggest the NDW will at most be marginally neutron rich. Note that for larger 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 the actual value of 𝑌𝑒 at the beginning of nucle- osynthesis can substantially differ from 𝑌𝑒,eq (see figure 4).

First, we consider the impact of varying 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 for a fixed 𝜔 = 2× 103 rad s−1. The final abundances for NDWmodels with 𝑀NS = 1.5𝑀 and 𝐿𝜈 = 3 × 1052 erg s−1 are shown in figure 6. These correspond to the NDW models shown in figure 4. In the absence of wave heating, this parameter set only undergoes an 𝛼-process that terminates with a peak around mass 90 (Woosley & Hoffman 1992) 8 B. Nevins and L. Roberts
