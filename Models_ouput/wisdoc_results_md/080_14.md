Observe that we can apply Lemma 3 to states 1, 2, 3. We also added cluster that consists of states 4, 5, 6, 7 so we can apply Lemma 4. In the former method we had that Q1 = {1a, .., 15a}, Q2 = {1b, .., 15b}, Q3 = {1c, .., 15c} and now ′ ′ Q′1 = Q1 ∪ {1}, Q = Q2 ∪ {2, 4, 5}, Q = Q3 ∪ {3, 6, 7}.

6 Conclusions and further work

We proposed a method of utilizing careful synchronization to provide brand new public key cryptosystem. In sections 3 and 4 we presented core idea of our method and provided an example that illustrates it. As the ciphertext in that method consists of n copies of the same automaton, those two sections are included to so the reader could understand the method presented in section 5. It should be also mentioned that lemmas 4 and 3 are only examples of extensions of that cryptosystem. Indeed, observe that Lemma 4 provides a possibility to add ”free” a-clusters to a ciphertext. The disadvantage of that extension is that we only can add b transitions to states that are some specified states of the copy of the public key. It is possible also to add the extension, that allows us to define the a-clusters for which we can define b transition outside of that specific sets Bi but to whatever state we want, even the other added a-cluster. However this |u|+1 extension would cause that in Lemma 5 it would be only {q1l , .., q } ∈ P.w l
