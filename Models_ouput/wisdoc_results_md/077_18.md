Table 6. Timewarp training parameters

\begin{tabular}{lccc} Dataset + training method & Batch size & No. of A-100s & Training time \\ \midrule AD --- likelihood & $256$ & 1 & 1 week \\ AD --- acceptance & $64$ & 1 & 2 days \\ 2AA --- likelihood & $256$ & 4 & 2 weeks \\ 2AA --- acceptance & $256$ & 4 & 4 days \\ 4AA --- likelihood & $256$ & 4 & 3 weeks \\ \end{tabular}

F. Computing infrastructure

The training was performed on 4 NVIDIA A-100 GPUs for the 2AA and 4AA datasets and on a single NVIDIA A-100 GPU for the AD dataset. Inference with the model as well as all MD simulations were conducted on single NVIDIA V-100 GPUs for AD and 2AA, and on single NVIDIA A-100 GPUs for 4AA.
