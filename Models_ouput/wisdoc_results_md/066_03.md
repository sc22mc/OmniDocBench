C(s)=D(s)+\lambda R(s).

To determine the distortion D(s) of the resulting LP frame, we cal- culate the MSE of the corresponding wavelet coefficients compared to the original signal according to [13]. In this work, not only the similarity of the LP frame to the odd-indexed frame, but also the similarity to the even indexed frame is considered, which is a very important aspect for many professional applications. The rate R(s) is composed of the required rate for lossless coding of the LP and HP frames and, in case of MC, the file size of the motion vectors. Then, the current decomposition can be evaluated locally by comparing the R-D costs of the children to the costs of the parent node for a given value λ. If the R-D costs of the child nodes exceed the costs of the parent node, thus if the following inequality

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{D(l_{i,[2t-1,2t]})+\lambda R(l_{i,[2t-1,2t]})\leq}}\\ {{(D(l_{i+1,2t-1})+D(h_{i+1,2t}))+\lambda R(l_{i+1,2t-1})+R(h_{i+1,2t}))}}\end{array}
$$

holds, then a further decomposition is prevented. The Lagrange mul- tiplier λ can be any positive value. By choosing large values for λ, the rate is decreased, while for small values the distortion is de- creased.

3.2. Handling of the Overhead

For lossless reconstruction, the decomposition depth for every part of the input sequence has to be transmitted additionally. Therefore, a vector v is generated, whose length corresponds to T . This vector is initialized with zeros and gets an increment of 1 at every temporal position of a LP frame after one decomposition level. The posi- tion to the corresponding HP frame is set to zero. Consequently, the non-zero entries correspond to the number of applied decomposition levels i for every temporal position of a LP frame, while the dis- tance d to the corresponding HP frame is given by d=2i−1. For the schematic video sequence in Fig. 2, vector v is generated as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}{{\mathrm{Initialize}}\,\boldsymbol{v}:}&{(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)}\\ {\boldsymbol{v}\;\mathrm{after~level}\;i{=}1:}&{(1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)}\\ {\boldsymbol{v}\;\mathrm{after~level}\;i{=}2:}&{(2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0)}\\ {\boldsymbol{v}\;\mathrm{after~level}\;i{=}3:}&{(3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0)}\end{array}
$$

The entire vector v is encoded using Context Adaptive Binary Arith- metic Coding (CABAC) [14] and is transmitted to the decoder side. Then, for lossless reconstruction of the previous stage, the decoder can easily determine the decomposition level and the temporal posi- tions of the LP and HP frames regarding the original video sequence.

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Our simulation setup comprises surveillance videos, medical se- quences with contrast medium, and natural sequences from the HEVC test data set [15]. The dimensions are summarized in Ta- ble 1. The bit depth for all sequences constitutes 8 bits per sample. All surveillance sequences are characterized by a static background and some moving objects in the foreground. The medical sequences origin from Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), showing the inflow of a contrast medium into a human cranium in frontal and sagittal perspectives.

In the following, we will compare our proposed CA-WL to a uniform wavelet lifting (U-WL) with the same number of total de- composition levels. The single frames of each subband are encoded by JPEG2000, using the OpenJPEG [16] implementation with four spatial wavelet decomposition steps in xy-direction. Further, we evaluate the CA-WL and the U-WL with and without a block-based MC, respectively. For block-based MC, the block size is set to 8, while the search range starts with a size of 8 and is doubled for ev- ery decomposition level until a maximum size of 64. The increasing search range is important, since the input frames of higher decom- position levels have a larger temporal distance, which has to be cov- ered. To keep the computational effort realistic, we limit the incre- ment of the search range by 64 pixels. The resulting motion vectors are encoded using the QccPack library [17]. Then, the entire file size is composed of the rate resulting from each subband, the required motion vectors and the coding costs for transmitting vector v. The visual quality of the resulting LP subband is measured by the same metric as already used in Section 3.1, but in terms of PSNRLPt [13].

Table 2 gives the differences regarding PSNRLPt in [dB] and the entire file size in [%] of our proposed method compared to the U- WL for all data sets with and without the application of MC and for different values of λ. As can be seen in the right column, our method always results in a better visual quality compared to the U- WL. By increasing λ, the file size is reduced, while the PSNRLPt gains are also decreased. However, for λ=7, the PSNRLPt gains are still positive. By including MC into both methods, we are able to get a lower rate than for the U-WL, resulting in positive PSNRLPt gains at the same time. For λ=3, the file size can be reduced by up
