Plugging these expansions back into the Schrödinger equation (58) we obtain two new PDEs for the two com- ponents ψ0 and ψ1:

$$
i{\frac{\partial}{\partial\eta}}\psi^{0}={\frac{1}{2}}\left(\pi_{k}^{2}-\omega_{k}^{2}(\eta)\,{\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\pi_{k}^{2}}}\right)\psi^{0},
$$

(61)

$$
i\frac{\partial}{\partial\eta}\psi^{1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\pi_{k}^{2}-\omega_{k}^{2}(\eta)\right)\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\pi_{k}^{2}}\right)\psi^{1}+\varGamma,
$$

ψ1 + F, (62)

$$
{\mit\Gamma}=F(\eta,\pi_{k})=-{\frac{\pi_{k}^{4}}{3}}\psi^{0}(\eta,\pi_{k}),
$$

where F indicates a source term for the µ2-order equation that results to be dependent on the zero-order solution.

Now, the zero-order PDE (61) is the Schrödinger equation of a time-dependent harmonic oscillator with standard operators, but in the momentum polarization; therefore the solution ψ0(η, πk) is just the Fourier trans- form of ψ0(η, ξk), properly rescaled to account for the √ normalization of Hermite polynomials:

$$
\psi_{n}^{0}(\eta,\pi_{k})=(-i)^{n}\frac{h_{n}(\frac{\pi_{k}f}{|R|})}{\sqrt{2^{n}\,n!}}\sqrt{\frac{(R^{*})^{n}\,f}{R^{n+1}\,\sqrt{\pi}}}\ e^{-\frac{\pi_{k}^{2}I^{2}}{2R}}e^{i\alpha_{n}},
$$

(64)

where R has been defined in (44), and f and αn have the same expressions as before.

On the other hand, the first order PDE (62) is the same of the zero order one but with the addition of the source term F (η, πk). In order to solve it, we consider that the eigenfunctions ψn(η, πk) form a complete orthonor- mal basis such that 〈ψn1 |ψn2〉 = δn1,n2 and any function can be expressed as a linear combination of them. There- ∑ ∑ fore we can write ψ1 and ψ0 as

$$
\psi^{0}=\sum_{n}\,c_{n}(\eta)\,\psi_{n}(\eta,\pi_{k}),\quad\psi^{1}=\sum_{n}\,d_{n}(\eta)\,\psi_{n}(\eta,\pi_{k}),
$$

(65)

where cn(η), dn(η) are time-dependent coefficients; when we plug these expansions back into the first order Schrödinger equation (62) we are left with just a recur- rence relation for the coefficients, since all the eigenfunc- tions ψ0n satisfy the zero-order equation (61) that corre- sponds to the homogeneous part of the first order one: ∑ ∑

$$
i\sum_{n}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\,d_{n}}{\mathrm{d}\eta}\,\psi_{n}^{0}(\eta,\pi_{k})=-\frac{\pi_{k}^{4}}{3}\,\sum_{n}\,c_{n}(\eta)\,\psi_{n}^{0}(\eta,\pi_{k}).
$$

πk). (66)

Considering just the ground state and using the result √ (43) for πk, we obtain

(63)

$$
\pi_{k}^{4}\,\psi_{0}=\frac{3}{4}\frac{R^{2}(R^{*})^{2}}{f^{4}}\psi_{0}\!-\!\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{R^{3}R^{*}}{f^{4}}e^{2i\varphi}\psi_{2}\!+\!\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\:\frac{R^{4}}{f^{4}}e^{4i\varphi}\psi_{4};
$$

(67)

it is thus clear that, when cn = δ0,n, the only non-zero coefficients on the left hand side are d0, d2 and d4. There- fore the relations for these coefficients are:

$$
i\frac{\mathrm{d}\,d_{0}}{\mathrm{d}\eta}=-\frac{1}{4}\,\frac{(1+f^{2}f^{\prime2})^{2}}{f^{4}},
$$

(68)

$$
i\frac{\mathrm{d}\,d_{2}}{\mathrm{d}\eta}=+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\,\frac{(1+f^{2}f^{\prime2})(1-iff^{\prime})^{2}}{f^{4}}e^{2i\varphi},
$$

e2iϕ, (69)

$$
i\frac{\mathrm{d}\,d_{4}}{\mathrm{d}\eta}=-\frac1{\sqrt{6}}\,\frac{(1-iff^{\prime})^{4}}{f^{4}}e^{4i\varphi}.
$$

Finally, the ground state of our system in the πk repre- sentation is ∑

$$
\psi_{0}^{\mathrm{tot}}(\eta,\pi_{k})=\psi_{0}^{0}(\eta,\pi_{k})+\mu^{2}\,\sum_{n=0}^{2}d_{2n}(\eta)\,\psi_{2n}^{0}(\eta,\pi_{k}).
$$

πk). (71)

From here on we will omit the superscript indicating the order, since we expressed ψ1 and ψ0 as a linear combina- tion of ψn.

〈 〉 Now, in order to find the final spectrum of perturba- tions we have to evaluate the expectation value ξ̂2k on

the ground state; we can use the expression (42) and therefore write ∫ ∫ ∣∣∣2 〈 ∣∣ξ̂2k∣∣ψtot0 〉

$$
\begin{array}{rl}&{\big\langle\psi_{0}^{\mathrm{tot}}\big|\hat{\xi}_{k}^{2}\big|\psi_{0}^{\mathrm{tot}}\big\rangle=\displaystyle\int d\pi_{k}\,\psi_{0}^{\mathrm{tot*}}\hat{\xi}_{k}^{2}\psi_{0}^{\mathrm{tot}}=\int d\pi_{k}\Big|\hat{\xi}_{k}\psi_{0}^{\mathrm{tot}}\Big|^{2}}\\ &{=\displaystyle\int d\pi_{k}\,f^{2}\Big|\frac{1+\mu^{2}d_{0}}{\sqrt{2}}\,e^{i\varphi}\psi_{1}+\mu^{2}d_{2}e^{-i\varphi}\psi_{1}+...\Big|^{2},}\end{array}
$$

(72)

where the dots stand for terms proportional to ψ3 and ψ5, whose square modulus would contribute with terms of order µ4 which we would neglect. Given that the norm ∫ 2 of ψtot0 is easily calculated to be |N | = 1 + 2µ2Re(d0), since dπk|ψn| = 1, the normalized expectation value of ξ̂2k results to be〈 〉

(70)

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle{\frac{\left\langle\hat{\xi}_{k}^{2}\right\rangle}{\left|N\right|^{2}}}=\frac{f^{2}}{2{\left|N\right|^{2}}}\left(1+2\mu^{2}\Re(d_{0})+2\sqrt{2}\;\mu^{2}\Re(d_{2}e^{-2i\varphi})\right)=}}\\ {{\displaystyle{=\frac{f^{2}}{2}\,\left(1+\frac{2\sqrt{2}\;\mu^{2}\Re(d_{2}e^{-2i\varphi})}{1+2\mu^{2}\Re(d_{0})}\right).}}}\end{array}
$$

(73)

As expected, the zero-order term is the same as for the standard Spectrum (45); on the other hand, for the µ2- order correction we see that we only need d0 and d2 among the coefficients of the expansion.

Now, looking at equation (68) we see that the right hand side is real; therefore d0 has a purely imaginary time derivative, and its real time-independent part must be set through initial conditions; we will adopt the same prescription as in [33, 34] where we assume that the wave- function is in the instantaneous ground state at the be- ginning of inflation: we therefore write d0(ηs) = 0 and, since its real part is independent of time, it will remain zero throughout the evolution. Then we solve the inte- gral (69) for d2(η), insert it into the Spectrum and find ∣∣∣∣ the asymptotic behaviour:
