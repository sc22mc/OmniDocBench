Z2 as the inverse image of X . Since the codimension of Z2 in the secant bundle is 1, we can treat Z2 as an effective divisor, which aids in computation. In Section 4, we derive the main theorem which provides the degree formula for the 3-secant variety by using the refined Bezout’s theorem and the total Segre class computed in Section 3. Additionally, we compute the multiplicity of σ2(X) along X . In Section 5, we apply the main theorem to cases of curves and surfaces with explicit calculations.

2 Generalized double point formula

The generalized version of double point formula is one of a useful application of the refined Bezout’s theorem that is a fundamental theorem in intersection theory. The double point formula allows us to compute the degree of the intersection of two subvarieties of a projective space. In this paper, we will use it as a starting point to understand the complexity of the 3-secant variety in terms of the 2-secant variety.

To set the stage for the generalized version of double point formula, we first introduce

some notation and conventions. Let X be an algebraic scheme over a field k and ⊕ ν

· be a sheaf of graded OX-algebras. We assume that the map OX → S0 is ν

·

· surjective, S1 is coherent, and S is generated by S1. We define the cone of S as the

·) relative spectrum C := Spec(S and the projection C → X . The projective cone of

·

·) is defined as the relative projective spectrum P (C) := Proj(S with the projection

·[z]) P (C) → X . We also define P (C ⊕ 1) := Proj(S as the projective completion of C, with projection q : P (C ⊕ 1)→ X , and let O(1) be the tautological line bundle on P (C ⊕ 1).

Remark. Throughout this paper, we use the convention for projective bundle as in [8, Appendix B.5.5].

With these conventions in place, we can now define the Segre class of a cone.

Definition 1. (cf. [8, Chapther 4])

For a variety V , we denote the algebraic cycle corresponding to V as [V ]. The Segre class of C is the class in A∗(X) defined by

$$
s(C):=q_{\ast}(\sum_{i\geq0}c_{1}(\mathcal{O}(1))^{i}\cap[P(C\oplus1)]).
$$

There are two useful examples of total Segre classes of cones: when the cone is given by a vector bundle, in which case the Segre class can be interpreted as the inverse of the total Chern class, and when the cone is the normal cone of a closed embedding, in which case the Segre class is called the Segre class of the closed immersion and is denoted s(X, Y ).

The codimension i part of the Segre class, si(C), of a cone C is defined in [7] as

$$
s^{i}(C)=q_{*}(c_{1}({\mathcal{O}}(1))^{i}\cap[\mathbb{P}(C\oplus 1)]),
$$

where i ≥ 0. The projective completion of C is denoted as P (C ⊕ 1) in [8] and as

These two notations refer to the same concept. Alternatively, si(C) P(C ⊕ 1) in [7].

can also be represented as p∗(c1(O(1))i−1 ∩ [PC]), where p : PC → X is the projective cone of C.
