Figure 5: Third step of encryption.

The third step involves adding transitions from Σ to those states in B, which have undefined transitions for letters from Σ. In that case we add only b letters. For example we defined ρ(1a, b) = 2b. We should act similarly for all states, for which b is undefined, but we have only added some of the necessary transitions so the figure is readable.
