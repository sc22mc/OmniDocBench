reached a peak of 2 Crab at 2-20keV aroundMarch 20 (Shidatsu et al. 2018), and then the source stayed in the hard state for roughly three months with slowly decreasing luminosity (Shidatsu et al. 2019). This unusually long and bright hard state makes it an excellent target to study the rich soft and hard X-ray spectral and timing phenomena (e.g. Kara et al. 2019; Ma et al. 2020; Stiele & Kong 2020; You et al. 2021). As optical LFQPOs are observed at frequencies nearly identical to that seen in the X-ray band (Yu et al. 2018b,a), multi- wavelength timing observations of the LFQPOs will provide critical clues to the origin of the LFQPOs as well (Mao et al. 2022).

Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) consists of three payloads: high energy X-ray telescope (HE, 20–250 keV), medium energy X-ray telescope (ME, 5–30 keV), and low energy X-ray telescope (LE, 1–15 keV)(Zhang et al. 2020). The technical details of Insight-HXMT can be seen in data reduction guide1. In- sight-HXMT has performed high cadence monitoring observations for this outburst. The broad X-ray energy band and the high count rate during the hard state observations provide us an opportunity to explore the energy spectrum evolution on short timescale. In this work, we use the Insight-HXMT data to explore the broadband X-ray spectral variation within the LFQPO timescale.

2 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

2.1 Data reduction

We used the observation taken on March 27, 2018 (ObsId P0114661006), when the flux is near its maximum of the hard state (Shidatsu et al. 2019). The exposure time of this observation is about 3400s.

We used the Insight-HXMT data analysis software HXMTDAS v2.05 to extract the data from three payloads. To avoid contamina- tion from nearby sources, we chose the narrow FOVs for all three telescopes. For creating good-time-intervals (GTIs), we used the sug- gested criteria in the guide. We then generated the energy spectrum and the corresponding background from the screened event, as well as the light curve of 8ms resolution.

2.2 Spectral analysis

Wegrouped the spectrawithminimumof 20 counts per bin. The spec- tral fitting performed by XSPEC version 12.11.1 with Chi statistics. We apply thismodel constant×TBabs×(diskbb+reflkerr) to fit the spectra with energy bands 2–8keV for LE, 10–30keV for ME, 35– 150keV for HE. The constant factor is used to account for differences of flux calibration between different payloads. The TBabs accounts for interstellar absorption, with 𝑁𝐻 fixed at 1.5 × 1021𝑐𝑚−2(Uttley et al. 2018), where abundances and cross sections of the absorption by the Galactic interstellar medium are set according to Wilms et al. (2000) and Verner et al. (1996). The diskbb is a multiple black- body component. The reflkerr is a relativistic reflection model which includes a thermal Comptonization continuum as the illumi- nating source (compps), which is one of the most accurate models of this process, and a hybrid model of rest-frame reflection hreflect (Niedzwiecki et al. 2019). The ionization parameter of the disk log 𝜉 is defined as the same way as the xillver (Garcia &Kallman 2010), 𝜉 = 4𝜋𝐹irr/𝑛𝑒, where the 𝐹irr is the irradiating flux in the 13.6 eV- 13.6 keV photon energy range and 𝑛𝑒 is fixed as 1015𝑐𝑚−3, andwith- out taking into account the ionization gradient. The comparison

between the reflkerr and the other popular relativistic reflection model relxill is extensively shown in Dziełak et al. (2019).

During the spectral fitting, we fixed the black hole spin at 0.13 (Zhao et al. 2021) and the inclination angle at 63◦ (Atri et al. 2020). The disk temperature is set as the seed photon temperature for Comp- tonization. The normalization of the diskbb component 𝑁disk is ex- pressed as (𝑅𝑖𝑛/𝐷10)2 cos 𝜃, where 𝑅𝑖𝑛 is the inner disk radius in km, 𝐷10 is the distance to the source in units of 10 kpc and 𝜃 is inclination angle. We obtained 𝑁disk ' 816(𝑅in/𝑅g)2 by taking the distance as 2.96 kpc (Atri et al. 2020), the black holemass as 8.48𝑀 (Torres et al. 2020), and the inclination angle as 63◦ (Atri et al. 2020). Then 𝑁disk is tied to the parameter 𝑅in (in unit of 𝑅g) in reflkerr as 816𝑅2in. The best-fitting parameters are shown in the first row of Table 1. The reduced chi-square value indicates that ourmodel is ade- quate to describe the data. We also noticed that some spectral fittings need an additional unchanged non-relativistic reflection component during the hard state (Buisson et al. 2019; You et al. 2021). However, whether including the non-relativistic reflection component does not affect the estimation of the relativistic reflection component and the Comptonization component (You et al. 2021).

2.3 Timing analysis

We generated the power density spectra(PDS) of different energy bands by using powspec with frequency resolution 𝑑𝜈 = 1/512 Hz and Nyquist frequency 𝜈𝑁 = 256Hz.We then calculated the rms nor- malized power by dividing the mean count rate for different energy bands respectively(van der Klis 1995, and references therein) and subtracted the white noise. We rebined the PDS with a geometric in- dex of 1.08 and fitted the broadband noise with three Lorentzians and the QPO and its harmonic frequencies with three narrow Lorentzians in XSPEC v12.11.1. The best-fitted reduced 𝜒2 are all less than 1.0. The PDS data and the best-fitting model are plotted in Figure 1. The LFQPO around 0.044 Hz is clearly detected as indicated by the curves in black in different energy bands. We show the best-fitting LFQPO results in Table 2. The central frequency of the LFQPO is constant with the same in different energy bands. The RMS of the LFQPO however decreases with photon energy in the energy range above ∼10 keV, which is different from other black hole transients (e.g. Huang et al. 2018).

Figure 2 shows the light curves of three instruments with time resolution of 5 seconds. There are visible flares on the timescales similar to that of the detected LFQPO. In order to quantitatively identify the peak (high intensity) and trough (low intensity) phases of the flares corresponding to the LFQPO waveform, we used the local maxima/minima method to select the extreme from the beginning to the end of the light curve. The method takes a fixed-width window and moves in order from the light curve without overlapping, picking the extreme values of the curve in the window with each move. Since the central frequency of the detected QPO is 0.044 Hz with an FWHM is 0.013 Hz (roughly corresponding to a timescale 20- 30 seconds), we then set the window width as 25 s in order to match the QPO cycles. We set the minimum intensity 𝐹min and the maximum intensity 𝐹max of the light curve as two reference flux baselines and their intensity difference is Δ𝐹. In order to ignore the flares with small fluctuations, we exclude peaks below 𝐹max−0.7Δ𝐹, and troughs above 𝐹min + 0.18Δ𝐹. Under the above conditions, we selected 113 peaks and 118 troughs, which 113 pairs of peak and trough phases are adjacent. The selection of the peak phases and the trough phases was only performed in the LE light curve, which is shown in Figure 2.
