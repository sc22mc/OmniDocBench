Figure 8. Comparison of the total, summed final abundances of all nuclides with mass 𝐴 ≥ 150 (representative of the strength of any r-process taking place) with the quantity 𝑠3/𝑌 3𝑒 𝜏𝑑 evaluated when seed formation begins. The relationship between 𝑠3/𝑌 3𝑒 𝜏𝑑 and𝑌𝐻 is necessarily approximate due to the presence of wave heating during seed formation. The relationship found in Hoffman et al. (1997) was derived under the assumption of constant entropy, which is not generally true in our models. Nevertheless, we still observe a strong correlation between the two quantities, which helps to provide a qualitative explanation for the variation in heavy element nucleosynthesis near 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 = 10−3. These results are for the same parameters as those in figure 7, with a finer grid in 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 .

Figure 9. Final abundances for the NDW profiles shown in figure 5. For high frequencies, the shock heating begins early enough to drive a strong r-process even for a 1.5𝑀 neutron star. Instantaneous shock formation is illustrated by the black dashed line, showing the final abundances for a wind that immediately experiences shock heating from waves with 𝜔 = 2 × 103 rad s−1.

Figure 10. Final abundances using the same parameters as in figure 6, but assuming that shock heating begins instantaneously in the wind. We see that a strong r-process takes place even for moderate 𝐿𝑤 .

Figure 11. Final abundances using the same parameters as in figure 7, but with antineutrino energies tuned to𝑌𝑒,eq = 0.52. We see r-processing regimes appear, despite a neutrino spectrum that would otherwise have precluded r- processing entirely.

final abundances for 𝑀NS = 1.5𝑀 , 𝐿𝜈 = 3 × 1052 erg s−1, and 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 = 10−3. For 𝜔 < 104 s−1, the nucleosynthesis is similar to the models with 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 ≈ 10−3 that efficiently form seed nuclei, as discussed in the preceding paragraphs. Comparing to figure 5, shock heating begins only after the beginning of seed formation and there- fore the resulting increase in entropy only has a limited impact on the nucleosynthesis. On the other hand, for the largest frequency consid- ered (𝜔 = 104 rad s−1), a full r-process pattern extending through the third peak is produced. Here, the wave heating due to weak shocks begins before the start of seed formation. Therefore, the substantial increase in the entropy inhibits seed formation, and leaves a large neutron-to-seed ratio when alpha capture ends. This is mainly driven by the impact of 𝜔 on the shock heating activation radius, and less so by the variation in 𝑙𝑑 with 𝜔. This is illustrated by the model shown in figure 9 that assumes 𝜔 = 2 × 103 rad s−1 but an instantaneous activation of shock heating. This results in nucleosynthesis that is very similar to the 𝜔 = 104 rad s−1 model.
