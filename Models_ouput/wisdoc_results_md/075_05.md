$$

are spanned by subsets of B and ortho-adjacent to each of X,Y, Z. ′ Consider any Z ∈ G∞(H) ortho-adjacent to each of X,Y, Z. The subspaces ′ X,Y, Z, Z are mutually compatible and there is an orthonormal basis B′ such ′, ′ that all these subspaces are spanned by subsets of B′. Then X ∩ Y,X Y are ′, also spanned by subsets of B′ and each of the 1-dimensional subspaces P, P Q,Q′ ′ ′∩Z ′, contains a vector from B′. The subspace Z contains X ∩Y , the subspaces X ′ ′ Y ∩ Z are 1-dimensional and

$$
Z^{\prime}=(X^{\prime}\cap Z^{\prime})\oplus(X\cap Y)\oplus(Y^{\prime}\cap Z^{\prime})
$$

′ is ortho-adjacent to X and Y ). Recall that

$$
Z=P\oplus(X\cap Y)\oplus Q.
$$

′ ′ ′ Since X ∩ Z is a 1-dimensional subspace of X containing a vector from B′, it ′. ′ ′ ′ coincides with P or P Similarly, Y ∩ Z coincides with Q or Q′. Then Z and Z ′ are ortho-adjacent only when Z is Z1 or Z2.

Let X,Y be elements of G∞(H) whose intersection is of codimension Lemma 2. ′ 2 in both X,Y . If there are ortho-adjacent Z,Z ∈ G∞(H) such that each of them is ortho-adjacent to both X,Y , then X,Y are compatible.

′ ′ Proof. We assert that Z ∩ Z is contained in X or Y . If Z ∩ Z is not contained ′ in X , then Z ∩ X and Z ∩ X are distinct hyperplanes of X and their sum is X . ′ ′∩Y Similarly, if Z∩Z 6⊂ Y , then Z∩Y and Z are distinct hyperplanes of Y whose ′ ′ sum is Y . Then Z +Z contains both X,Y . Since Z ∩X and Z ∩X are subspaces ′, ′. of codimension 2 in Z+Z the subspace X is a hyperplane of Z+Z For the same ′. reason, Y is a hyperplane of Z + Z Then X,Y are adjacent which is impossible. ′ Without loss of generality, we can assume that Z ∩ Z is contained in X . Then ′ Z ∩ Z is a hyperplane of X . The orthogonal complement of X ∩ Y in X + Y is 4-dimensional and we denote this subspace by M . Then

$$
X^{\prime}=X\cap M\,{\mathrm{~and~}}\,Y^{\prime}=Y\cap M
$$

′ are 2-dimensional subspaces whose intersection is 0. Observe that each of Z,Z contains X ∩ Y and is contained in X + Y which implies that

$$
S=Z\cap M\,{\mathrm{~and~}}\,S^{\prime}=Z^{\prime}\cap M
$$

′ are distinct 2-dimensional subspaces. Since Z ∩Z is a hyperplane of X and X ∩Y ′, is contained in Z ∩ Z

$$
Z\cap Z^{\prime}\cap M=S\cap S^{\prime}
$$

′ is a 1-dimensional subspace of X which will be denoted by P . The subspaces

$$
Z=(X\cap Y)\oplus S,\;\;Z^{\prime}=(X\cap Y)\oplus S^{\prime}
$$

′ ′ are ortho-adjacent to Y = (X ∩ Y ) ⊕ Y and, consequently, S and S′ intersect Y in certain 1-dimensional subspaces P1 and P2, respectively. The subspaces P1, P2 ′ are distinct (since S = P + P1 and S = P + P2 are distinct). ′, ′. Show that S and S′ are compatible to both X Y The following statement is well-known [17, Lemma 1.14]: if a closed subspace A ⊂ H is compatible to closed subspaces B,C ⊂ H , then A is compatible to B ∩C, B + C and B⊥. This implies that Z is compatible to X ∩ Y and X + Y (since Z is compatible to X,Y ). Then Z is compatible to
