2 Single assets subject to reinvestment

We assume that the price At is a function of three variables: (i) time t, (ii) a discounting curve rt, (iii) additional market risk factors xt. This means we have At = At(rt, xt). The additional market risk factors xt depend on the specific asset and applied pricing model. For instance, in case of a bond or credit default swap xt might be a tuple consisting of a credit spread curve, a recovery rate assumption, and a liquidity spread (e.g. such as the negative basis as introduced in [Mai (2019)]). The sub-index t at the interest rate object r = rt and the market factor x = xt indicates that the states of these input variables depend on the time point. If we write As(rt, xu) we price the asset at time s with the discounting curve from time t and the market factor variables at time v, noticing that this is a theoretical number that has not been observed at some time point (it is in general different from As = As(rs, xs)). Given this, we decompose the PnL due to a change in asset values as follows, taking into account the three different driving factors interest rate (r), market risk (x), as well as carry (due to time t passing):
