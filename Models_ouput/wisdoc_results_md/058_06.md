Proof. For part (i), as f ∈ S∗p , then due to the geometry of the function 1 + P0,π(z) = 1 + 2/π2(log((1 +√ √ z)/(1− z)))2 it can be observed that

$$
\operatorname*{max}_{|z|=r}\Re(1+\mathcal{P}_{0,\pi}(z))=1+\mathcal{P}_{0,\pi}(r).
$$

Now for f(z) to lie in the class FLP , we must have

$$
r_{0}=|z|<(1/4)(3\sqrt{5}-5).
$$

))2

$$
1+\frac{2}{\pi^{2}}\left(\log\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{r}}{1-\sqrt{r}}\right)\right)^{2}\leq\frac{3}{2},
$$

which holds provided r ≤ RFLP (S∗p ). Clearly equality in (i) is attained for the function f̃(z) such that ′(z0)/f̃(z0) zf̃ = 1 + P0,π(z0) at z0 = RFLP (S∗p ). Further observe that, if p ∈ P[A,B] = {p(z) : p(z) = ∣∣∣∣ 1 + c1z + c2z . . . ≺ (1 +Az)/(1 +Bz),−1 ≤ B < A ≤ 1}, then for |z|= r < 1, it is a known fact that∣∣∣∣p(z)−

$$
\left|p(z)-\frac{1-ABr^{2}}{1-B^{2}r^{2}}\right|<\frac{|A-B|r}{1-B^{2}r^{2}}.
$$

(2.2)

Then, in view of (2.2), for part (ix) f ∈ S∗(A,B) lies in FLP , if

$$
\frac{(A-B)r+1-ABr^{2}}{1-B^{2}r^{2}}\leq\frac{3}{2}
$$

Equivalently, we can say that (1 − Br)((2A − 3B)r − 1) ≤ 0, provided r ≤ RFLP (S∗(A,B)). Extremal ′(z0)/f̂(z0) ∈ A satisfying z0f̂ function in this case is f̂

= (1 + Az0)/(1 + Bz0), where z0 = R̃. For part √ (iv), as f ∈ FLP , then proceeding as before, f lies in S∗% if for |z|= r we have 3/2 ≥ cosh r, provided √ ′%(z)/f%(z) r = RFLP (S∗% ). Sharpness holds for the function f% ∈ A defined as zf = cosh z. Further we know that max|z|=r Re(1 + sin z) = 1 + sin r, then for part (ii) it is enough to find an r < 1 satisfying

the equation sin r = 1/2, thus r = RFLP (S∗s ) = π/6. Sharpness holds for the function fs(z) given by ′s(z)/fs(z) zf = 1 + sin z. In all the subsequent parts, the proofs follow along the same lines, therefore they are omitted.

Let Pα consist of functions of the form p(z) = 1 + c1z + c2z2 + . . . , satisfying Re p(z) > α for 0 ≤ α < 1, then we say p(z) is a Carathéodory function of order α. Denote P(0) =: P, commonly known as the class of Carathéodory functions. Further, assume PLP to be the class of functions of the form p(z) = 1 + c1z + c2z + . . . , such that p(z) ≺ LP(z). √ √
