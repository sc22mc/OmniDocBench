$$
\omega_{k}^{2}(\eta)=k^{2}-\frac{z^{\prime\prime}}{z}.
$$

(29)

The momentum conjugate to ξk is defined as πk = ξ ′ k and we finally obtain the Hamiltonian for the scalar pertur- bations: ∑ ∑

$$
\mathcal{H}=\sum_{k}\mathcal{H}_{k}=\sum_{k}\frac{\pi_{k}^{2}}{2}+\frac{\omega_{k}^{2}(\eta)}{2}\xi_{k}^{2}.
$$

(30)

In order to calculate the Power Spectrum, we will make the assumption that during the inflationary era the evo- lution is dominated by the Cosmological Constant and therefore all other components are negligible; besides, if inflation starts late enough, we will have ρ ρµ and, as mentioned in the last section, we can neglect the correc- tion factor in (15):

$$
H^{2}=\frac{\rho_{\Lambda}}{3}=H_{s}^{2},
$$

(31)

where Hs is the constant Hubble parameter of infla- tion. Note that, to be precise, in a pure de Sitter uni- verse the background matter field is set to a constant value and thus, in principle, it does not make sense to speak about its perturbations. This is shown explicitly in the appearance of the slow-roll parameter ε, which in this limit should be vanishing; indeed in this case a Power Spectrum cannot be obtained since inflation never stops. Nonetheless, the computations can be performed by keeping the slow-roll parameter as a non-vanishing constant, and this particular case represents a very good and easy-to-compute example to derive a Power Spec- trum. In this regime the conformal time acquires a pre- cise dependence on the scale factor and the frequency ωk greatly simplifies:

$$
\eta=-{\frac{1}{aH_{s}}},
$$

(32)

$$
\omega_{k}^{2}(\eta)=k^{2}-\frac{2}{\eta^{2}}.
$$

(33)

Now we can perform the quantization of the sys- tem and proceed to compute the Power Spectrum. We will first briefly present the standard Spectrum derived through the canonical quantization, and then find the modified spectrum coming from the algebra (12).

A. Standard Power Spectrum

Here we will compute the standard Power Spectrum. In the standard representation of Quantum Mechanics, the two operators corresponding to the Fourier modes will obey the standard commutation relations and will have the standard action:[

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\left[\hat{\xi}_{k},\hat{\pi}_{k}\right]=i,}\end{array}
$$

(34)

$$
\hat{\xi}_{k}\,\psi(\xi_{k})=\xi_{k}\,\psi(\pi_{k}),\quad\hat{\pi}_{k}\,\psi(\xi_{k})=i\frac\partial{\partial\xi_{k}}\psi(\xi_{k}).
$$

ψ(ξk). (35)

A single Fourier mode has Hamiltonian Hk with a time-dependent frequency ωk(η); therefore the wavefunc- tions ψ(η, ξk) will obey a time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the form

$$
i{\frac{\partial}{\partial\eta}}\psi(\eta,\xi_{k})={\frac{1}{2}}\left(-{\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\xi_{k}^{2}}}+\omega_{k}^{2}(\eta)\xi_{k}^{2}\right)\psi(\eta,\xi_{k}).
$$

ψ(η, ξk). (36)

This is the Schrödinger equation of a harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency. The solution to such a system can be found through the method of invariants

[30–32] and is a superposition of the following normalized wavefunctions:

$$
\psi_{n}(\eta,\xi_{k})=\frac{h_{n}(\frac{\xi_{k}}{f})}{\sqrt{2^{n}\,n!}}\,\frac{e^{-\frac{\xi_{k}^{2}}{2f^{2}}}}{(\pi f^{2})^{\frac{1}{4}}}\,e^{i\frac{f^{\prime}}{2f}\,\xi_{k}^{2}}\,e^{i\alpha_{n}},
$$

eiαn , (37) where αn = αn(η) = −(n + ∫ f−2dη is a time- dependent phase, hn are Hermite polynomials and f = f(η) is an auxiliary function that is the solution of the following differential equation:

$$
f^{\prime\prime}+\omega_{k}^{2}f-f^{-3}=0.
$$

(38)

The Spectrum for ξk can then be calculated by link- ing its perturbations to the curvature perturbations [29], yielding ∣∣∣∣∣

$$
{\cal P}^{\mathrm{std}}(k)=\left.\frac{k^{3}}{4\pi^{2}}\,\frac{\langle0|\hat{\xi}_{k}^{2}|0\rangle}{a^{2}\epsilon}\right|_{-k\eta\ll1}
$$

where η → 0− corresponds to t→ +∞ so that −kη → 0 is the large scale limit. The expectation value of ξ̂2k is computed on the vacuum state i.e. the ground state of the time-dependent oscillator; we therefore need to know how to express the result of ξ̂kψn. This can be done by constructing ladder operators for the time-dependent system: they take the form

(39)

$$
\hat{a}^{\dagger}=\frac{\frac{\hat{\xi}_{k}}{f}-i(f\hat{\pi}_{k}-f^{\prime}\hat{\xi}_{k})}{\sqrt{2}},\quad\hat{a}^{\dagger}\psi_{n}=\sqrt{n+1}\;e^{i\varphi}\psi_{n+1};
$$
