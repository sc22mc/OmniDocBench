τ(Q′, a) is not defined. We also note Q.w as an action of a word w on a set of states Q under the function δ. Let S ⊆ Q. Then we denote S.w−1 as a preimage of S under the action of a word w.

We note that the above concepts can also be considered for deterministic fi- nite automata (DFA), for which the transition function is total. We define an a-cluster to be a DFA A = (Q, {a}, δ) such that the automaton is connected. In other words it means that such automaton is a cycle on letter a with paths that leads to the states of that cycle. The set of states that induce a cycle in the a-cluster is referred to as the center of the cluster. The depth of the cluster is the length of the longest path to the center of the cluster. If q belongs to the center of the a-cluster, the branch of the state q are the states that has a path to q that does not have any other state belonging to the center. Destination of the branch is a state in the center that has an in-transition from the last state of the branch. Example of the a-cluster is depicted on Figure 1.

Figure 1: Example of the a-cluster

Center of that a-cluster is the set {3, 4, 5, 6}, the depth is 2 and there are two branches: b1 = {1, 2} and b2 = {7}. Destination of the branch b1 is the state 3 and of the branch b2 is state 4.

We define the sum of two automata A = (Q1,Σ1, δ1) and B = (Q2,Σ2, δ2) as A∪B = (Q1∪Q2,Σ1∪Σ2, δ1∪δ2). We can now state the obvious fact, useful to decide whether a given PFA is carefully synchronizing.
