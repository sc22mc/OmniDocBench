ABSTRACT

The neutrino-driven wind from proto-neutron stars is a proposed site for r-process nucleosynthesis, although most previous work has found that a wind heated only by neutrinos cannot produce the third r-process peak. However, several groups have noted that introducing a secondary heating source within the wind can change the hydrodynamic conditions sufficiently for a strong r-process to proceed. One possible secondary heating source is gravito-acoustic waves, generated by convection inside the proto-neutron star. As these waves propagate into the wind, they can both accelerate the wind and shock and deposit energy into the wind. Additionally, the acceleration of the wind by these waves can reduce the total number of neutrino captures and thereby reduce the final electron fraction of the wind. In neutron rich conditions, all of these effects can make conditions more favorable for r-process nucleosynthesis. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the impact of these convection-generated gravito-acoustic waves within the wind on potential nucleosynthesis.We find that wave effects in the wind can generate conditions favorable for a strong r-process, even when the energy flux in the waves is a factor of 10‚àí4 smaller than the total neutrino energy flux and the wind is marginally neutron-rich. Nevertheless, this depends strongly on the radius at which the waves become non-linear and form shocks. We also find that both entropy production after shock formation and the acceleration of the wind due to stresses produced by the waves prior to shock formation impact the structure and nucleosynthesis of these winds.

1 INTRODUCTION

After its formation in a core-collapse supernova, a proto-neutron star (PNS) cools by emitting some 1053 erg in neutrino radiation (see Bur- rows & Vartanyan 2021, for a recent review on supernova theory). After a successful supernova explosion, the PNS is left surrounded by a relatively low density region and it continues to emit neutrinos. Neutrino interactions deposit sufficient energy in the outer layers of the PNS to unbind some material in a neutrino-driven wind (NDW), first predicted by Duncan et al. (1986). The NDW is powered mainly by charged-current neutrino interactions, which can both heat the material and alter its neutron-to-proton fraction. Depending on the spectrum of the neutrinos emitted by the cooling PNS, the neutrino- driven wind could become either neutron- or proton-rich. If the wind becomes neutron-rich, there is a possibility for the rapidly outflow- ing gas to undergo r-process nucleosynthesis (e.g. Woosley et al. (1994), Thompson et al. (2001), Wanajo (2013), and see Arcones & Thielemann (2012) for a recent review).

The material ejected from the PNS begins in nuclear statistical equilibrium, and as it cools begins forming large numbers of ùõº parti- cles. In a neutron-rich wind, nearly all the protons will be bound into ùõº particles when the wind reaches a temperature of ‚âà 5GK. Triple-ùõº

reactions and subsequent ùõº captures then form a number of heavy ‚Äôseed‚Äô nuclei, before charged-particle reactions freeze out as the tem- perature in the wind continues to drop (Woosley & Hoffman 1992). Free neutrons can then capture onto these seed nuclei as the wind moves outward and produce r-process nuclei (Meyer et al. 1992). The determining factor for whether a strong r-process can take place is the ratio of free neutrons to seed nuclei when seed formation ends. The three primary factors influencing this are the electron fraction, which sets the free neutron abundance; the entropy of the wind dur- ing seed formation; and the dynamical timescale of the wind during seed formation (Hoffman et al. 1997). The influence of the electron fraction is clear: a strong r-process requires an abundance of free neutrons, and specifically, a high neutron-to-seed ratio so that the heaviest elements can be formed. At constant temperature, a higher entropy implies a lower density. The triple-ùõº and neutron-catalyzed triple-ùõº reactions that form the initial seed nuclei are 3- and 4-body interactions, which scale strongly with density. Thus, a high entropy means that these reactions will be much less efficient, resulting in fewer seeds being formed, and increasing the neutron-to-seed ratio in the wind. Finally, the dynamical timescale of the wind determines how long seed formation can proceed before charged particle re- actions freeze out. A short dynamical timescale means that fewer seeds will have the chance to form. A sufficiently short dynamical timescale can also compensate for a lower entropy in this way, and 2 B. Nevins and L.
