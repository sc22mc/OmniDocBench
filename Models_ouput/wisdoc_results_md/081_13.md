PNS Convection and NDW r-Processing 13

Figure 14. A measure of r-process strength across our parameter space, using a wave frequency of 2 × 103 rad s−1 and 𝑌𝑒,eq = 0.48, and assuming the waves immediately shock and begin to deposit heat into the wind. We see that for higher, but still quite reasonable wave luminosities, r-processing takes place nearly independent of PNS mass and neutrino luminosity. The r-processing parameter space broadens to very low wave luminosities at higher masses as the wave stress becomes significant.
