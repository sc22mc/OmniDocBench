Here 𝑟 is the distance of the from the centre of the PNS, and 𝑣 is the radial velocity of the wind. The total heating rate per baryon is ¤ 𝑞tot = ¤𝑞𝜈 + ¤𝑞𝑤 , where the first term is due to neutrino heating and cooling (see Qian & Woosley 1996) while the second term is due ¤𝑌𝑒 to wave damping. is the rate of change in the electron fraction of the wind due to neutrino reactions (see Qian & Woosley 1996). The wave damping length and frequency are 𝑙𝑑 and 𝜔 ( ¤𝑞𝑤 , 𝑙𝑑 and 𝜔 are discussed in section 3.2 below). 𝑇 , 𝑐𝑠 , 𝜌, and ℎ denote the local temperature, sound speed, density, and enthalpy, respectively. 𝑊 is the Lorentz factor, and 𝑣𝑔 = 𝑣 + 𝑐𝑠 represents the group velocity √︃ of the waves. 𝐺 and 𝑐 represent the gravitational constant and the 2𝐺𝑀𝑁𝑆 speed of light, and 𝑒Λ = 1 − . Corrections from the wave 𝑟𝑐2 stress are denoted by 𝛿 𝑓1 and 𝛿 𝑓2 (see section 3.1 below). Without

the wave action terms, this system is the same as that of Thompson et al. (2001). We employ the equation of state of Timmes & Swesty (2000), which assumes the wind is made up of free protons, neutrons, electrons, positrons, and thermal photons. We search for solutions of these equations that pass through the critical or transonic point where 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 pass through zero at the the same radius.

3.1 Wave Stress

Even in the absence of damping, waves in a stellar atmosphere still exert a force on the medium through which they move. This effect is calculated using the wave action, and adds an extra stress to the momentum equation (e.g. Jacques 1977; Suzuki & Nagataki 2005). For simplicity, we derive these corrections in the non-relativistic limit.

In the absence of wave stress, the non-relativisticmomentum equa- tion for this system is

$$
v\frac{\partial v}{\partial r}=-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}-\frac{GM_{\textrm{NS}}}{r^{2}}
$$

(6)

Combining this with the other conservation equations yields the non- relativistic critical form equation(

$$
\begin{array}{rl}&{\bigg(v^{2}-c_{s}^{2}\bigg)\frac{dv}{dr}=\frac{v}{r}\bigg(2c_{s}^{2}-\frac{\textit{GM}}{r}\bigg)}\\ &{~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-\frac{v}{\rho}\left|\!\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial s}\right)_{\rho,Y_{e}}\frac{d\bar{s}}{dr}+\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial Y_{e}}\right)_{\rho,S}\frac{dY_{e}}{dr}\right|}\end{array}
$$

from which we extract the non-relativistic forms of 𝑓1 and 𝑓2: )2 𝑣 1 − 𝑓1 = 𝑐𝑠

$$

The non-relativistic momentum equation including corrections from wave propagation is (Jacques 1977)

$$
\rho^{v}\frac{dv}{dr}+\frac{d}{dr}\left(P+a_{1}\mathcal{E}\right)+\frac{\mathcal{E}}{A}\frac{dA}{dr}+\rho\frac{GM_{\textrm{NS}}}{r^{2}}=0
$$

Note that all terms from equation (7) are present, with an additional correction term on each side. This allows us to define corrections to the original 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 functions in equation (8):

$$
\begin{array}{rl}&{\delta f_{1}=\frac{a_{1}\mathcal{E}}{\rho c_{s}^{2}}\left(2\frac{v}{v_{g}}-A_{\rho}\frac{c_{_V}}{v_{g}}\right)}\\ &{\delta f_{2}=-\frac{a_{1}\mathcal{E}}{\rho c_{s}^{2}}\left[\left(A_{s}\chi_{e}-2A_{\rho}\right)\frac{c_{_V}}{v_{g}}+2\left(1-\frac{1}{a_{1}}\right)+\frac{r}{l_{d}}\right]}\end{array}
$$

(11)

These corrections are then applied to the fully relativistic 𝑓1 and 𝑓2 in equation (3).

3.2 Wave Heating

Acoustic waves propagating in the wind can become non-linear and shock heat the wind. We model this shock heating via an effective damping length prescription. Wave heating will only begin when the waves steepen into shocks and begin to dissipate their energy. Mihalas & Mihalas (1984) provides an integral expression for the ∫ radial distance at which this takes place:

$$
{\frac{1}{4}}(y+1)c_{\bar{S}}^{-1}\int_{0}^{r}u_{0}(r^{\prime})dr^{\prime}={\frac{\pi c_{\bar{S}}}{2\omega}}
$$

(12)

√︃ 𝜔𝑆 where 𝑢0 = is the amplitude of the velocity perturbation of the 𝜌

waves and 𝛾 is the adiabatic index of the background material. Here and elsewhere, 𝜔 represents the angular frequency (in the lab frame) √︄ of the waves. We then find the condition for shock formation to be∫

$$
\int_{0}^{r}{\sqrt{\frac{\omega S}{\rho}}}dr^{\prime}=\frac{2\pi c_{\textrm{S}}^{2}}{\omega(\gamma+1)}.
$$

(13)

In the weak shock limit (e.g. Mihalas &Mihalas 1984), the energy density of the waves 𝜖𝑠 evolves as

$$
\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(v_{g}\mathbf{\epsilon}_{s})=\frac{-\boldsymbol{m}}{\pi}\omega\mathbf{\epsilon}_{s}
$$

(14)

where 𝑚 = (𝑣/𝑐𝑠)2 − 1 is the reduced Mach number. In a static homogeneous background, the shock can be modeled as a simple saw-tooth wave, with energy density

$$
\epsilon_{s}=\frac{yPm^{2}}{3(y+1)^{2}}.
$$

(15)

In the weak shock limit, we take 𝜖𝑠 = 𝑆/𝜔, which allows us to find an expression for 𝑚 in terms of local quantities. Combining the wave action evolution in Eqs. (3) and (14), and assuming a constant 𝜔, we )1/2 find the dissipation length

$$
l_{d}=\frac{\pi\gamma^{2}}{\gamma+1}\left(\frac{c_{3}^{2}\xi}{3\omega^{3}S}\right)^{1/2}
$$
