Fact 1. Let A be a PFA and P(A) be its power automaton. Then A is carefully synchronizing if and only if for some state q ∈ Q there exists a path in P(A) from Q to {q}. The shortest synchronizing word for A corresponds to the shortest such path in P(A).

An example of a carefully synchronizing automaton Acar is depicted in Fig. 2. One of its carefully synchronizing words is aa(ba)3bbab.

We recall the result of Vorel [26] about the complexity of deciding whether a PFA is carefully synchronizing.

Theorem 1. Given a PFA A = (Q,Σ, δ), checking if A is carefully synchro- nizing is PSPACE-complete even for |Σ| = 2.

Further we assume that Σ = {a, b} and the letter a is defined for all the states wherever not mentioned otherwise. Having that we can go to the description of our method.

3 Basic encryption

Let a plain text be the word u ∈ {0, 1}∗. Choose a public key to be a carefully synchronizing PFA A = (Q,Σ, δ) and a private key to be any word w that carefully synchronizes A. For simplicity of further statements we note Ai = (Qi,Σ, δi) to be isomorphic to A for any i ∈ N. First we describe a construction that is a ciphertext.
