PNS Convection and NDW r-Processing 11

Figure 12. Ameasure of r-process strength across our parameter space, using a wave frequency of 2× 103 rad s−1 and𝑌𝑒,eq = 0.48, and using the shock heating prescription from equation (13). Two regimes of r-process production emerge: a region of high wave and neutrino luminosities across all masses, driven by shock heating; and a region of moderate wave and neutrino luminosities driven by the wave stress, which becomes significant at larger neutron star masses.
