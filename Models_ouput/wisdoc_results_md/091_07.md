sensitivity to certain sample properties. While single-frequency measurements are quick and straightforward, frequency sweeps, as in this study and in [14], [15], and [17], detect small variations across frequencies, although requiring more time. The choice between frequency range and single-frequency measurement depends on specific measurement goals. Overall, this method presents a novel approach to fruit quality investigation.

IV. CONCLUSION

In this work, EIS was employed as a noncontact method for assessing fruit quality. The investigation focused on two setups: first, a preliminary trial including four bananas and soap, and secondly, the examination of 51 nectarines. Both cases yielded promising results with the noncontact capacitive measurement method. During the initial setup, spanning seven days, the noncontact technique effectively observed the banana’s aging process, showing a noticeable decline in series capacitance (Cs) with time. This sensitivity to biological changes allowed clear differentiation between the aging banana and the stable soap. Moreover, the correlation between capacitance and temperature underscored the necessity for temperature correction during data processing.

To explore temperature effects, simultaneous measurements of sample presence and absence were conducted, unveiling the impact of aging and environmental factors on system response. This innovative approach presents a means to mitigate tempera- ture andother influences effectively. In addition, by analyzingCs response to banana sample mass loss, the method acknowledges the role of biochemical changes over time in assessing fruit quality. In setup 2, the noncontact technique assessed mechani- cal damage in 51 nectarines, revealing an immediate increase in Cs postdamage, followed by a subsequent decrease after 24h. This dynamic response reflects complex cellular alterations triggered by mechanical damage, including cell content leakage andmembrane integrity changes. Themethod’s ability to discern damaged fruit, even 24 h postdamage, suggests real-time quality evaluation feasibility in industrial settings.

Overall, these findings clear up the complex relationship between aging, mass loss, damage detection, capacitance re- duction, and fruit properties, offering significant implications for industry and fruit quality assessment. The nondestructive, real-time nature of this technology presents an efficient means for fruit quality verification, enabling swift sorting, andminimiz- ing financial losses. Future enhancements inmeasurement setup, calibration, and integration with automated sorting systems hold promise for increased productivity and customer satisfaction. Ultimately, this method stands to revolutionize fruit processing, reducing waste, and enhancing produce quality and safety.
