2.4 Short-timescale energy spectra of the LFQPO: the peak phase vs. the trough phase

Then we performed spectral fits to all the energy spectra on 5 second time scales which were extracted in the time intervals corresponding to the peak phase and the trough phase, respectively. For each en- ergy spectrum, we performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling in XSPEC, with the sampling algorithm from the emcee software package (Foreman-Mackey et al. 2013). We fixed the following three parameters: the constant value, the iron abundance 𝐴Fe, and the ion- ization parameter log 𝜉 to the same as the average energy spectrum. We set 20 walkers with the prior parameters from the average energy spectrum fitting result in subsection 2.2. We used a Gaussian prior with a center as the best-fitting value from the parameters of the averaged energy spectrum and a width as 20%.We set 5,000 walkers and 5,000 burn-in steps. The median value of the posterior samples is taken as the best-fitting value for each free parameter. The 68% interval of reduced chi-square extracted from the median value of posterior chi-squares is 0.93 to 1.1, which indicates that all the 5s energy spectra are well-fitted by the model.

We then obtained the best-fitting parameters for all the X-ray spec- tra extracted on the 5 second time scale. The histogram of the best- fitting spectral parameters in the peak, trough and other phases are plotted(Figure 3). Then the mean value and 68% interval (16%-84%) for each parameter of each phase are also calculated. We can see that the inner disk radius 𝑅in, the electron temperature 𝑘𝑇e and the op- tical depth 𝜏 show almost identical distribution between peak and trough. The other three parameters are larger in the peak phase than

in the trough phase. Especially, the 68% intervals of the normaliza- tion 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 and the reflection fraction R show no overlap, indicating a significant difference between these two parameters between peak and trough phases. According to the results, we obtain that the peak and trough phase short timescale spectral parameters 𝑇𝑖𝑛, R and 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 are different at least 50%, 76% and 96% significance level. So at least the spectral parameter 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 significantly changes with the QPO phases . We also generated the respective PDSs for all best- fitting parameters of the short timescale spectra, but only the PDS of the 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 shows an apparent QPO feature at the same frequency.

The most significant difference between the energy spectra cor- responding to the peak and trough phases is the normalization (see Figure 3). The normalization determines the photon flux of both Compton and reflection components by the same factor. The reflec- tion fraction R also varies between peak and trough phases. The photon flux of the reflection component is determined by 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 × R (Niedzwiecki et al. 2019). So the variation of R makes the flux vari- ability of the reflection component different from that of the Comp- ton component. The normalization and reflection fraction are also found to significantly vary with the QPO phase in another BHXRB H1743−322, in which the normalization is also the parameter that bears the most significant change (Ingram et al. 2017). There is also difference in the inner disk temperature 𝑇in between that of the peak and of the trough. Since the disk component was very weak in the observation and the inner disk temperature is tied to the seed photon temperature for Compotonization in the model we applied, we can not distinguish whether the variation in 𝑇in was due to intrinsic disk variability or potential variation in the Compton component.

2.5 Averaged energy spectra corresponding to the LFQPO peak and trough phases

In order to compare the energy spectra corresponding to the peak and trough phases in detail with enough statistics, we stacked all the 5-second energy spectra corresponding to either phase. Correspond- ing response files were generated using the tool ADDSPEC and the background file was generated using the tool MATHPHA, respectively. We also used the same spectral model that was used to fit the aver- age energy spectrum to fit the stacked energy spectra. We fixed the constant value, the iron abundance 𝐴Fe and the ionization parameter log 𝜉 in the model at the same values obtained in the spectral fit of the average energy spectrum. The best-fitting spectral parameters corre- sponding to the peak and the trough phases are listed in Table 1. The best-fitting spectral parameters corresponding to the peak and trough phases agree with each other, except for the normalization 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚, the reflection fraction R. The 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 and R of the peak and trough phases are different by at least 97% and 70% significance levels, which is consistent with the statistical results of the 5-seconds spectra.

We plotted the unfolded energy spectra of peak/trough phases in the top panel of Figure 4. The best-fitting models of the Compton and reflection components are also added in the Figure 4. The spectral shape of the Compton components are almost the same at the peak and the trough phases, since only 𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚 changes and other parameters related to Compton (such as 𝑘𝑇e and 𝜏) remain nearly constant. On the other hand, the spectral shape of the reflection component at the peak phase is different from that at the trough phase, since the reflection fraction R is larger. The reflection component dominates over the Compton below ∼30 keV, and the Compton component becomes dominated above ∼70 keV in both peak and trough phases.

The fractional photon flux change in the Compton component between peak and trough phases (𝐶P-𝐶T) is almost the same for different energies since the normalization is the only parameter that
