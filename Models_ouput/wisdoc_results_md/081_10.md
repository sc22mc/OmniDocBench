Therefore, as a limiting case given the uncertainty in the shock activation radius and to compare to previous work (Suzuki & Na- gataki 2005; Metzger et al. 2007), we show in figure 10 final abun- dances for varied 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 for 𝜔 = 2 × 103 rad s−1, 𝑀NS = 1.5𝑀 , 𝐿𝜈 = 3×1052 erg s−1, but with instantaneous activation of the shock heating. The results are noticeably different than those shown in fig- ure 6, which shows models with the same parameters but without instantaneous shock heating. For instantaneous activation, the aver- age mass of the abundance distribution increases monotonically with 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 and for even moderate wave luminosities is able to produce a full r-process. This illustrates that uncertainty in the shock for- mation radius translates into significant uncertainty in the predicted nucleosynthesis for gravito-acoustic NDWs.

To illustrate the important impact of the reduced electron fraction from the wave contributions, we show in figure 11 abundance dis- tributions from a wind with 𝑀𝑁𝑆 = 1.9𝑀 , 𝐿𝜈 = 6 × 1052, and 𝑌𝑒,eq = 0.52. In the absence of wave effects, the neutrino spectrum used here should preclude any r-processing whatsoever. The wind would undergo an alpha-rich freezeout, leaving only free protons to capture onto seed nuclei. However, with wave effects included, we find similar r-processing regimes to those obtained with neu- trino energies tuned to 𝑌𝑒 = 0.48. In the wave stress regime, with 5× 10−4 . 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 . 5× 10−3, the change in 𝑌𝑒 is not large enough to make the wind neutron rich, but the faster outflow caused by the wave stress prevents an 𝛼-rich freezeout from occurring. R-process elements are then synthesized from the free neutrons in the wind, despite the wind being overall proton-rich. This gives rise to the suppressed, actinide-free r-process patterns in figure 11. In between the r-processing regimes, we again find a region where the combined entropy and dynamical timescale in the wind favor strong seed for- mation and thus no r-processing, regardless of 𝑌𝑒 or the presence of an 𝛼-rich freezeout. At high 𝐿𝑤 , the wind becomes neutron-rich again, and early wave heating suppresses seed formation and drives the same strong r-processing as in figure 7.

5.2.3 Nucleosynthesis in the 𝐿𝑤 - 𝐿𝜈 - 𝑀NS parameter space

In figure 12, we show the total final abundance of nuclei with mass number 𝐴 ≥ 150 as a function of 𝐿𝜈 and 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 for a variety of PNS masses. Here, we have used 𝑌𝑒,eq = 0.48, 𝜔 = 2 × 103 rad s−1, and assumed the shock formation radius is given by equation 13. We find the abundance of nuclei with 𝐴 ≥ 150 to be an effective proxy for the strength of the r-process in the wind (see e.g. figure 7). Two r-processing regimes appear. For the highest neutrino and wave luminosities, shock heating begins early enough in the wind to drive a strong r-process. This shock heating regime is fairly insensitive to PNS mass but very dependent on wave frequency, which sets how early shock heating can begin in the wind. The second r-processing regime, driven by acceleration due to the wave stress, is strongly dependent on mass but insensitive to wave frequency. We see this regime emerge at a PNS mass of around 1.8𝑀 , and grow to dom- inate the parameter space for the most massive neutron stars. The

non-monotonic dependence of the average mass number of the final abundances is also visible here. At higher masses, the wave stress contribution is able to drive strong r-processes even for very low neu- trino and wave luminosities, where shock heating begins too late to strongly affect the nucleosynthesis. We have also run similar calcu- lations with 𝑌𝑒,eq = 0.45. These show qualitatively similar behavior to the results shown in figure 12, except that the onset of wave stress- driven r-process nucleosynthesis is shifted to lower PNS mass.

In order to quantify the impact of the reduced electron fraction due to the wave stress contribution, we show in figure 13 the same parameter set as in figure 12, but with 𝑌𝑒 fixed to a constant value of 0.48. We find that including a self-consistent 𝑌𝑒 evolution results in a noticeable broadening of the region in 𝐿𝜈-𝐿𝜈/𝐿𝑤 space where the r-process occurs, especially the wave stress-dominated regime at lower 𝐿𝑤 and 𝐿𝜈 . This is perhaps to be expected, as the change in 𝑌𝑒 is driven primarily by the wave stress reducing the amount of neutrino heating needed to unbind thewindmaterial.We also observe generally higher yields of r-process material when 𝑌𝑒 evolution is included, due to the higher number of free neutrons available.

Finally, in figure 14, we show the impact of instantaneous shock formation on nucleosynthesis across the entire parameter space (once againwith𝑌𝑒,eq = 0.48 and𝜔 = 2×103 rad s−1, and self-consistently evolving𝑌𝑒). In this case, we find third peak r-process production for nearly all considered neutrino luminosities and PNS masses when 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 & 2 × 10−4. Although the acceleration of the wind due to the wave stress plays a role in determining the nucleosynthesis in these models, the impact of the waves is mainly driven by the shock heating that they provide.

6 CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the impact of gravito-acoustic waves launched by PNS convection on the dynamics and nucleosynthesis of the neutrino-driven wind. When these waves propagate through the NDW, they impose additional stresses on the wind and also may shock and provide an extra source of heating. Using steady-state, spherically symmetric models for the wind that include the impact of an acoustic wave energy flux, we surveyed the parameter space of the gravito-acoustic wave luminosity and frequency that is expected to be produced by PNS convection. The presence of shock heating in the wind precludes reliance upon the common predictive metric 𝑠3/𝜏𝑑 , as entropy is no longer nearly constant during seed forma- tion. Therefore, using the results of our hydrodynamic models, we then performed calculations of nucleosynthesis for the marginally neutron-rich compositions that may be encountered in some NDWs.

For 𝐿𝑤 & 10−5𝐿𝜈 , the waves strongly impact the dynamics of the wind via two mechanisms, acceleration due to wave stresses and entropy production via wave shock heating. Acceleration of the NDW by wave stresses reduces the dynamical timescale, but also reduces the entropy and electron fraction of the wind since a faster wind has less opportunity to undergo neutrino heating. Depending on 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 , this competition between reduced dynamical timescale and reduced entropy can make conditions more or less favorable for strong r-process nucleosynthesis.

Similarly to previous work (Suzuki & Nagataki 2005; Metzger et al. 2007), we find that if the wave energy is deposited (in our case through shock heating) before r-process seed nucleus formation begins, the entropy of the wind at seed formation is substantially increased. This in turn results in an alpha-rich freeze out and more favorable conditions for producing nuclei in the third r-process peak. Here, we found that the exact position of shock formation has a strong
