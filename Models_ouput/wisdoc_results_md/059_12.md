History Conversation Sessions

Hello! Tell me something about yourself!

I like animals and have a kind heart.

That’s really nice :) it’s cool to find someone with a nice heart.

Yes, having a doctor mom and fireman dad has made me very kind in general.

That’s great! My parents are a bit different, my dad is a truck driver.

Does he ever read while driving? I am a big reader myself.

That’s dangerous. We’re more of an active family though, I like working outdoors. I prefer to sit on the couch with my animal friends and read.

Nice! I also play basketball often. My outdoor genes come from my canadian mother. I sometimes like to go hiking with my animal friends as well.

Oh nice :) hiking is tough because it takes me longer to walk, since I’m short.

I’m really kind, so I wouldn’t make fun of you if you went hiking with me.

What book are you currently reading?

I’m reading a Stephen King novel. Are you reading anything? What’s your favorite genre of book?

Oh nice, I like Stephen King too. Which of his novels are you reading? I like dystopian fiction, currently reading Margaret Atwood, supporting Canadian authors lol

I’m reading his newest novel, Later. Oh, I’ve seen a TV adaptation of one of Margaret Atwood’s books!

Is it Handmaid’s tale? I love that show

Yes, me too. It was dark, but thought provoking. Do you recommend anything else like it?

After I read Handmaid’s Tale I read 1984, which was similar. I read it in highschool, but couldn’t truly appreciate it back then.

1984. That’s written by George Orwell?

Yup, he also wrote Animal Farm, which is also very dark and thought provoking, and you might like it since it’s about animals!

Yeah, I do like dark and thought provoking movies. Bonus that it’s about animals. I’ll try giving it a shot. You seem to know a lot of literature.

I used to sit in the truck on long trips with my dad, and had nothing to do other than read.

Ah, that makes sense. I started reading when my parents were at work. My mom was working a lot, and sometimes she brought me to the hospital where I’d read at her desk. What does your mom do for work?

Current Conversations

I looked into the 1984 book we were speaking about before. oh ya? did you start reading it yet?

Yeah! It was much better this time around I definitely understood all of the nuances now that I am older!

I always thought it was a little bit weird to have us read it in high school. definitely more to appreciate to read as an adult i think. have you picked out the next book that you want to read yet?

I’m not sure what I want to read next! I can be very indecisive. Do you have a good book to recommend?

hmm.....i read a book once call 1984 which is a very surreal type book, which sounds like what you like! warning though, it is very long. i really think it might be up your alley if you can commit to that long of a book

I definitely have a lot of free time right so I will take a look at it!
