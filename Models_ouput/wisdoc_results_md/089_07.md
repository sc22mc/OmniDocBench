the feature extraction that will require more time to be computed and also more memory to store them temporarily during the computation. So it is important to find a tradeoff between the required accuracy of the predictions and the hardware resources that can be very limited in case of IoT devices that in most of the cases are microcontrollers powered by a small battery that should last for months or years before the replacement.

IV. CONCLUSION

The results indicate that larger classifier models exhibit greater accuracy in detecting the presence of the queen bee. However, it is noteworthy that these models also demand more computational resources making them less practical for IoT ap- plications. In scenarios where edge computing on small battery- powered devices is essential for extended operational periods, smaller classifiers may be more suitable despite a potential decrease in accuracy.

We can notice also the importance of having an extensive number of datasets to generate models that are not specific to a particular beehive but can adapt to others as well. In this work, we observed that having data from different hives slightly reduces accuracy but enhances generalization capabilities of the classification models. The size of the audio files also has a significant effect on the accuracy of the machine learning models used. Here, it is necessary to find a compromise between prediction accuracy and the memory space used to record the audio, which also leads to an increased number of computations needed to process and extract features.

Lastly, information compression into a reduced number of values is essential. This allows for a reduction in the complexity of the classifier model without losing too much information and degrading performance excessively. Overall, the findings demonstrated superior performance when employing STFT compared toMFCC features. However, this improvement comes at the expense of increased memory demands for storing such data on a potential IoT device. This suggests the necessity for a trade-off, coupled with the implementation of effective feature selection techniques.

In summary, the research emphasizes the efficacy of audio- based methods for detecting the queen bee in beehives. While larger classifiers offer superior accuracy, their resource-intensive nature poses challenges for IoT applications. Achieving a bal- ance between accuracy and resource efficiency is crucial in these contexts,making smaller classifiersmore practical for prolonged operational periods without sacrificing essential detection capa- bilities.
