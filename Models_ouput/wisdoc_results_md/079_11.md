Changing the parametrization in φ, into a parametrization in ψ, yields for the surface area : ∫

$$
|\partial{\cal E}_{a}|=2(n-1)\kappa_{n-1}\int_{0}^{\pi/2}(\cos(\psi))^{n-2}\frac{a}{(1+(a^{2}-1)\sin^{2}(\psi))^{1/2}}d\psi.
$$

When a = 1, one recovers |∂E1| = 2(n − 1)κn−1Wn−2 = 2κn−1nWn = nκn. When a > 1, one

gets |∂Ea| = λ(anκn), where λ ∈ (a−1, 1) is defined via : (∫ )−1 ∫

$$
\lambda:=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}(\cos(\psi))^{n-2}\frac{1}{(1+(a^{2}-1)\sin^{2}(\psi))^{1/2}}d\psi\left(\int_{0}^{\pi/2}(\cos(\psi))^{n-2}d\psi\right)^{-1}
$$

.

Hence TM , the image of the half-ball M under T , is a half-ellipsoid whose “isoperimetric ratio” is given by :

$$
\mathrm{Isop}(TM)=\frac{|\partial{\cal E}_{a}|}{n|{\cal E}_{a}|}+\frac{2\kappa_{n-1}}{n|{\cal E}_{a}|}=\lambda+\frac{1}{anW_{n}}.
$$

The unique face F of TM satisfies Isop(F ) = 1 : hence TM satisfies the condition of Prop 2, as 1anWn soon as a is such that : λ < 1−

1anWn If n = 2 and a ≥ 3, then 1 − = 1 − > , and one can easily check λ < , so that aπ

Isop(TM) < 1 holds. Since (ψ 7→ (1 + (a2 − 1) sin2(ψ))) is increasing in ψ ∈ [0, π/2], one may upper ∫ )1/2) bound λ = λa :

$$
\lambda=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\frac{1}{(1+(a^{2}-1)\sin^{2}(\psi))^{1/2}}d\psi<\frac{2}{\pi}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}+\frac{\pi}{4}\left(\frac{2}{a^{2}+1}\right)^{1/2}\right)<\frac{3}{4}\ \ (\mathrm{if}\ a\geq3).
$$

π2(n+1) π √ √ √ If n ≥ 3, then we use the estimate < W < , yielding )−1/2 2n

$$
nW_{n}>\sqrt{\frac{\pi n}{2}}\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{-1/2}>\sqrt{\frac{\pi n}{2}}\left(1-\frac{1}{2n}\right)\geq\frac{5}{6}\sqrt{\frac{\pi n}{2}}>\sqrt{n},
$$

1anWn √ and so 1− > 1− √ 1a√n n−2, One may check that if a ≥ 4n n, then λ = λa < 1 − . Indeed, letting wψ := cos(ψ) ∫ ∫ similarly as in the 2-dimensional case, one may upper bound λ by splitting the integral :
