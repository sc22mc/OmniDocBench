4) Several researchers have attempted to use machine learn- ing and deep learning algorithms to preprocess the hyper- spectral images and then detect and classify the diseases.

However, one common challenge for computer-aided al- gorithms is that it requires good quality and a large amount of data to process the hyperspectral images. If a smaller dataset is used, the results might be biased and unable to detect the diseases well. Therefore, during the data acqui- sition period, a good-quality camera and a large amount of data (approximately 10k above) should be collected so that the models do not face overfitting issues.

5) The data processing of hyperspectral imaging is also com- plex and computationally expensive, which can impede timely analysis [316], [317]. Methods such as PCA, used in the feature extraction part, can be computationally de- manding to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional hyperspectral data [318]. In addition, machine learning techniques for regression and classification (such as SVM orRF) can increase the need for high computational power and time. This reduces the chance of being implemented in real-time/resource-limited settings, such as crop moni- toring [319], [320]. One potential solution to overcome these issues could be employing parallel processing to manage computational load and reduce computational time by ensuring the data integrity and accuracy of the

results/analysis [321]. Besides, batch processing [322], data sampling [323], and hardware acceleration [324] can be employed to enhance the hyperspectral data processing.

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

This article extensively reviews plant disease detection using hyperspectral imaging techniques. Hyperspectral imaging is a nondestructive, fast, reliable technique. Hyperspectral imaging is a nondestructive, fast, reliable technique that can be employed to detect plant diseases. With the advent of such technologies, human perceptions are extending further to the visible spec- trum [17]. This aids in classifying the infected plants, assessing and analyzing the disease severity, classifying the pathogens, and detecting the early symptoms of plant diseases before the human eyes can detect them.

One of the most pressing issues of the current hyperspec- tral imaging is the inability to detect plant diseases at their early stages. The current systems are capable of detecting dis- eases when they are visibly infested. Hence, developing re- mote sensing platforms that can monitor the disease growth at the emerging stages is crucial. The placement of sensors or the distance between the sensors and the diseased plants is one of the crucial factors for image analysis. This is because the distance of the sensor is directly related to the spatial resolution
