CERTAIN DIAGONAL EQUATIONS AND CONFLICT-AVOIDING CODES OF PRIME LENGTHS 17

This holds for p = 7 and g = 3. The remaining two cases −g2± g+ 1 = 0 are equiv- −g2 + g+ 1 = 0 −g−2 − g−1 + 1 = 0. alent because if and only if

In other words, we only need to consider the equality g2 = g+ 1 over Fp. Such a primitive root g is called a Fibonacci primitive root modulo p, as the golden ratio ϕgr satisfying ϕ gr ϕgr + 1. The primes p such that Fp has a Fibonacci primitive root is the sequence A003147: 5,11,19,31,41,59,61,71,79,109, . . . on OEIS [Slo]. Consequently, we have

N(p,(p−1)/2)> 0 if and only if Fp has a Fibonacci primitive root. On the other hand, p−1|H| the order |H| of the subgroup H = 〈−1,2〉 is an even integer. It follows that ℓ0 = p−1 must divide . By Proposition 5.3, we see that Equation (2) is solvable over Fp if Fp has a Fibonacci primitive root. In this case, there exists a solution (x,y) ∈ F2p such that xy 6= 0 and thus Conjecture C holds.

Proposition 5.4. If Fp has a Fibonacci primitive root, then Conjecture C holds for this p.

On a related issue, for the valid cases in Conjecture C established above we would like

to know how many prime numbers p are there such that the subgroup H generated by −1 and 2 has the given index ℓ0 in F×p . This question can be viewed as a generalization of the Artin’s primitive root conjecture. It is shown in [Mur91, Theorem 1] that there are infinitely many primes p such that the index [F×p : H] = ℓ0 under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). Assuming GRH, we conclude from Corollary B that there are infinitely many prime numbers p with ℓ0 satisfying conditions in Theorem 5.2 and therefore, the size of optimal CACs of prime lengths is equal to M(p, ℓ0) for infinitely many primes p.
