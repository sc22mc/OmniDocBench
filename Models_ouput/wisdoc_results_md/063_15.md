CERTAIN DIAGONAL EQUATIONS AND CONFLICT-AVOIDING CODES OF PRIME LENGTHS 15

Proof. By Theorem 4.3, the result holds for q ≥ 194. For q < 194 and q ≡ 1 (mod 6), we first look at q = 7 and q = 13. When q = 7, one has x6 = 1 for all x ∈ F×7 . But

g2+g+1 6= 0 for any primitive root g of F7. So it is not solvable in this case. For q= 13, 6+1= x6 =±1 for all x ∈ F×13. It is easy to check that g2X6+gY 0 is not solvable for all primitive roots g= 2,6,7,11 of F13. For the rest of cases that 13< q< 194, the following table gives a solution for some primitive root g:

5. APPLICATION: CONFLICT-AVOIDING CODES OF WEIGHT 3

In this section, we apply our main result to the construction of CAC. We consider the × special case where q = p and ℓ = ℓ0 the index of H in F . Let’s start with a proof of Corollary B.

Proof. Let p be a prime such that the multiplicative order op(2) of 2 is not a multiple of 4. Suppose that p satisfies the condition

$$
\boldsymbol{p}\ge(2^{\boldsymbol{o}(\ell_{0})}(\ell_{0}-\boldsymbol{3}-\boldsymbol{\delta})+2)^{2}-\boldsymbol{2}
$$

where δ = 1 if 4 | ℓ0 and δ = 0 otherwise. It follows from Theorem A that there exists a generator g of F×p such that Equation (2) is solvable over Fp.By Corollary 2.3 for 1≤ ℓ0≤ 4 and Lemma 2.1 for ℓ0 ≥ 5, we see that there exists a solution (x,y) ∈ F2p to Equation (2) satisfying xy 6= 0. Thus, Conjecture C and hence Conjecture B holds for prime numbers p satisfying the inequality given above. As it is explained in Section 1, Conjecture A is also true for these prime numbers. Combining the algorithm given in [FLS14], we conclude

that an optimal CAC of length p and weight 3 has the size ⌊ ⌋

$$
\textit{M}(\boldsymbol{p},\ell_{0})=\frac{\boldsymbol{p}-1-2\ell_{0}}{4}+\left\lfloor\frac{\ell_{0}}{3}\right\rfloor
$$

as desired.

Our strategy for studying the size of optimal CAC of prime lengths is through inves- tigating Conjecture B (equivalently, Conjecture C). In the paper [MZS14] the authors announce that Conjecture B has been verified to hold for prime p≤ 230. Applying Corol- lary B, we are able to extend the range of prime numbers p such that Conjecture B holds.
