Figure 5. Early entropy profiles for a 1.5 𝑀 neutron star with 𝐿𝜈 = 3 × 1052 erg s−1 and 𝐿𝑤 = 10−3𝐿𝜈 with varied wave frequencies. For higher frequencies, the shock heating begins to increase the entropy in the wind earlier and has a larger impact where seed nuclei are formed. The impact of the shock prescription is illustrated by the black line, which shows the evolution of the entropy if the waves (with 𝜔 = 2 × 103 rad s−1) shock immediately instead of when equation 13 dictates.

Figure 7.Final nucleosynthesis results, using temperature and density profiles for a 1.9 𝑀 neutron star, with 𝐿𝜈 = 6 × 1052 erg s−1 and using a wave frequency of 2 × 103 rad s−1. A clear peak around mass 200 is indicative of a strong r-process taking place.

and is far from the conditions necessary for producing the third r- process peak. Increasing 𝐿𝑤 , we find that the peak of the abundance distribution increases in mass until 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 ≈ 10−4. Further increase of 𝐿𝑤 from this point briefly reduces the mass of the peak of the abundance distribution, but above 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 ≈ 10−3 a strong r-process emerges. The final abundances for NDWmodels with𝑀NS = 1.9𝑀 and 𝐿𝜈 = 6 × 1052 are shown in figure 7. Between 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 = 10−5 and 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 = 10−4, these models produce both the second and third r-process peaks, but between 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 ≈ 10−4 and 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 ≈ 10−3 production of the third peak is again cutoff and the peak of the abundance distribution is pushed down to lower mass. As 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 is increased above 10−3, a strong r-process re-emerges.

For both sets of parameters, we find the interesting behavior that r-process nucleosynthesis is inhibited for 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 in the approximate range of 10−4 - 10−3. This turnover in the maximum mass number is due to the competition between the decreasing dynamical timescale (𝜏𝑑) with 𝐿𝑤 , which inhibits seed formation, and the decreasing en- tropy (𝑠) with 𝐿𝑤 , which facilitates seed production by increasing the density at which alpha recombination occurs (Hoffman et al. 1997). Figure 8 illustrates the correlation between the quantity 𝑠3/𝑌3𝑒 𝜏𝑑 and the total abundance above mass 150. Despite entropy no longer being constant during seed formation, we do observe a fairly strong corre- lation between r-process strength and this quantity. We find that as the wave luminosity is increased, 𝜏𝑑 decreases slightly faster than the entropy, but eventually asymptotes to aminimumvalue of a few times 10−4 s. The entropy continues to steadily decrease, which creates the trough in 𝑠3/𝑌3𝑒 𝜏𝑑 as a function of 𝐿𝑤 and gives rise to the win- dow of inhibited r-processing we observe around 𝐿𝑤/𝐿𝜈 = 10−3. At higher 𝐿𝑤 , shock heating begins prior to alpha recombination, drastically increasing the entropy. This, coupled with the reduced electron fraction at high 𝐿𝑤 , reinvigorates a strong r-process.

Second, we consider the impact of varying 𝜔 on gravito-acoustic NDW nucleosynthesis. As was noted above, increasing 𝜔 results in an earlier activation of shock heating. In figure 9, we show the
