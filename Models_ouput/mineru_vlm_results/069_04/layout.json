Experiments in the phase 1a and 1b are fully reproducible in the selected group of meditators, we observe only a variation in intensity of temperature responses. We also observed a non- temperature response of surrounding electrochemical sensors on presence of meditators in all cases, however, detecting the exact begin and end of exercises, as shown in Fig. 7, was possible only in several attempts. Since this topic represents the focus of other works [29], [33], [34], it was not pursued further here. Control measurements were carried out a) in parallel to experimental sessions on separate calorimeters (as non- targeted sensors); b) during so- called 'empty sessions' (meditators were present but no sessions were conducted), several examples of control attempts are shown in Figs. 10(a)- 10(c)."
