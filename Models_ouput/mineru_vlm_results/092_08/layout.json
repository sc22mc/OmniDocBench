Throughout these three days, we collected measurements from a power- producing (i.e., active) and nonpower- producing (i.e., inactive) cell to identify similarities and differences between their impedance spectra. The EIS measurements were obtained at OCV with an Autolab PGSTAT302 N, a laboratory- graded potential that used as a reference. This instrument automatically measures OCV and triggers a measurement sweep whenever OCV is sufficiently stable. EIS measurements were executed with a setup matching the two- electrode configuration of the MAX30134 upon deployment (see Section III- C). The spanned frequency range starts at "
