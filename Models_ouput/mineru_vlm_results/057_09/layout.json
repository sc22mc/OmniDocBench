To minimize the impact of stress, we gave a few minutes break between each bug replay. At the end of the tasks, we provided 5- point Likert- scale questions to collect their feedback, in terms of clearness, conciseness, and usefulness. We further collected participants' feedback through a few open- ended questions, which can help us bring more insight into our tool, including how could the subtitles be improved, are there any software engineering tasks that would benefit from subtitles, etc."
