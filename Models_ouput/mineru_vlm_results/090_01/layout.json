Here, one of the main causes of stress is nutrient starvation, to which the plants respond with a series of well- studied physiological changes such as reduced photosynthetic activity and inadequate chlorophyll production leading to a clear impact on leaf greenness [3]. Among the most important nutrients for the plants correct physiological functioning, iron (Fe) plays an important role. In fact, despite its abundance in the soil, it results in an already low availability for the plant due to its low solubility [4]. Iron is, indeed, an essential micronutrient for plants contributing to several vital processes, including chlorophyll development and function. When plants lack sufficient iron, they experience reduced photosynthetic activity, resulting in yellowing and interveinal chlorosis in young leaves [5], leading to yield losses of up to "

Such visible symptoms typically manifest several days or weeks after iron deprivation begins, varying with crop species, but typically when the plant is already in a late stress stage [5]. For this reason, tools allowing a precise characterization of the plant nutrient levels and needs assume a crucial importance to early detect any stress and allow thus a timely intervention thereby leading to higher yields. In this context, different proximal monitoring methods have been described in the literature [7], with increasing"
