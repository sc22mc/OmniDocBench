Experiments in the phase 1 are separated into three subgroups 1a, 1b, 1c and are also aimed at studying the effect of a meditator in ASC on closely spaced sensors. Since the human person irradiates heat, produces electrostatic fields, mechanical impacts and other 'classical interactions', measures were taken to isolate 'classical' from 'non- classical' factors. For example, a heat- insulating container with 3- 5 liters of water delays the penetration of heat inside for 20- 25 minutes, see Fig. 4(a); this enables conducting short- term meditative experiments. In other cases, the meditators were separated from the measurement systems by a reinforced concrete wall, see Fig. 4(b)."
