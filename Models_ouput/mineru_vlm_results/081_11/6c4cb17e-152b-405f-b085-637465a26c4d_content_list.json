            "Figure 12. A measure of r-process strength across our parameter space, using a wave frequency of  $2 \\times 10^{3}$  rad  $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  and  $Y_{e,\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.48$ , and using the shock heating prescription from equation (13). Two regimes of r-process production emerge: a region of high wave and neutrino luminosities across all masses, driven by shock heating; and a region of moderate wave and neutrino luminosities driven by the wave stress, which becomes significant at larger neutron star masses."
