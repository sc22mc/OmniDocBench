Although close- range- based hyperspectral imaging platforms provide better precision agriculture analysis, some limitations must be mitigated. For instance, the enigmatic interaction between the target crops/plants, light sources, and nearby big trees (height) can affect the image acquisition process. In other words, the variation in illumination, the partial- shadowed or full- shadowed condition, can heavily influence the image quality and acquisition process [42], [43], [44], [45]. Based on the funding, time, and analysis requirements, researchers should choose the best platform to conduct the research in their respective fields."

UAVs can obtain high-spatial-resolution images through helicopters, drones, and multirotors with fixed wings. The UAVs are mounted with lightweight hyperspectral sensors. Some lightweight sensors are UHD 185-Firefly [46], [47], HySpex VNIR [48], [49], PIKA II sensor [50], [51], and Headwall Micro- and Nano-Hyperspec VNIR [52], [53], [54]. Most of these sensors operate within the VNIR range. They are also very lightweight and smaller, which can be mounted on UAV platforms. Literature studies show that multisensors and fixed-wing planes are used for data acquisitions [47], [55], [56], [57], [58]. Usually, low-altitude and slow flights are performed to obtain the high-spatial-resolution hyperspectral imaging [42]. Regarding flight operation, multirotors are preferred over fixed-rotor planes as they are more flexible and can be operated at low-flight altitudes. For fixed wings, the process requires a minimum flight altitude, a particular speed, and a launcher such as a parachute. Generally, multirotors are"
