Setup cost, which involves hardware and software systems, can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Other cost includes deployment cost, training of farmers on the use of the AIoT systems, maintenance costs, such as hardware replacement, and Internet costs. To overcome this challenge, there is a need to use AIoT to achieve a return on investment within a reasonable time. Also, collaboration between farmers and the government can help overcome the initial cost."

This can be time- and resource- consuming in monitoring and collection of data. The detection of leaf disease, as well as the collecting and labeling of a large number of disease photos, requires a huge amount of people, material resources, and financial resources. Some plant diseases have a shorter onset period and are more difficult to collect [9]. Furthermore, the storage and processing of datasets can be demanding. For instance, the use of high- resolution images and hyperspectral images involves the processing of a large amount of data. This poses some computational challenges. Hence, the need to employ parallel processing, batch processing, and hardware acceleration could solve these computational challenges and provide a real- time analysis as a viable solution."

These include the need for reliable infrastructure, such as power, connectivity, and durable hardware suitable for agricultural conditions. In addition, successful deployment requires collaboration among agricultural researchers, extension services, and farmers.

More research work is needed to deploy IoT energy- efficient systems in ginger farms that take into consideration low- power wide area communication technology or energy harvesting systems. The adoption of AIoT will enable the prediction of weather patterns and disease outbreaks in ginger farms. The provision of real- time monitoring of farm variables using IoT and prediction using ML algorithm will enhance ginger farm management greatly [89]."

The development of a smartphone application that can guide farmers in planting, harvesting, processing, and marketing of ginger is needed. Features, such as integrated pest management, that cover preplanting, sowing, vegetative stage, and rhizome development stage would be useful for ginger farmers. Lightweight DL models that can be deployed on smartphones for online and offline [90], [91], [92], [93] disease and pest management for ginger plants is an open research area."

Labor- intensive activities, such as sorting good and bad ginger seedlings, sorting ginger seedlings according to sizes, and ginger shoot orientations in planting [69], [81], can be automated. More research into the use of robotics for remote plant disease diagnosis and precision plant protection for ginger using virtual reality and digital twins is expected [94]. Also, the use of drones equipped with HSI for disease detection in ginger- cultivated fields is a promising area."
