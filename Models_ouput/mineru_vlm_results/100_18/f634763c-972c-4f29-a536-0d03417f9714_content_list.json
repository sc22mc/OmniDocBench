The reasoning examples utilized in the prompt for reasoning are derived from the corresponding Complex CoT publication Fu et al. (2022). As greedy decoding is used, we do not follow the self-consistency method Wang et al. (2022) to sample reasoning paths.- GPT3.5. With the standard prompt, the GPT3.5 model is used to generate the answer.- GPT3.5 ComplexCoT. Similar to the GPT4 ComplexCoT but change the model to GPT3.5.- GPT4 PHP+ComplexCoT. This is the GPT4 model employing greedy decoding (i.e. temperature  $= 0$ ) with the PHP Zheng et al. (2023)+Complex CoT Fu et al. (2022). Specifically, in the PHP Zheng et al. (2023) framework, the Complex CoT prompt is used to generate initial base answers, from which the PHP+Complex CoT can then develop the subsequent answer generation prompts. Thus, at the beginning of the interaction, by passing a concatenation of the base prompt of Complex CoT and the current question to the LLM, the base answer can be generated. Then, relying on the Complex CoT prompts revised into the PHP version with additional hint sentences, the progressive-hint prompting framework is performed on this base answer to update the hint over interactions to generate the right answer. We refer to this as the PHP+Complex CoT corresponding to the Progressive-Hint Prompting Complex CoT (PHP-Complex CoT) in the original work Zheng et al. (2023). The number of shots from Complex CoT is 8.- GPT4 BoT wo/experience. The GPT4 model is used to perform reasoning with the proposed BoT framework without the experience accumulation. The basic settings of BoT follow those presented in the main paper. Therefore, after one iteration, the aggregated chain will be used as the solution.- GPT4 BoT. The GPT4 is used to perform reasoning with the full version of BoT as shown in the main paper.- GPT4 BoT + CoT. Apart from the BoT framework, 5 reasoning examples from the CoT Wei et al. (2022) publication are included in the prompt. Therefore, in each iteration, the prompt contains not only experience but also additional 5 CoT reasoning examples.- GPT3.5 BoT. Similar to the GPT4 BoT but change the model to GPT3.5.- GPT3.5 BoT (GPT4). In this experiment, we utilize the GPT3.5 to perform reasoning, thus generating thought chains in the Thought Structure Generation. However, when performing the thought evaluation and the experience generation in the aggregated Thought Chain Analysis, the GPT4 model is used to get the evaluation and the analysis feedback.",

In all seven categories, GPT4 BoT is at least 0.8% higher than GPT4 PHP+ComplexCoT, and the corresponding number on the Algebra problems is even 12.5%. Similar for GPT3.5 BoT and GPT3.5 BoT + CoT.
