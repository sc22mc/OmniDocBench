            "Fig. 3: Spectrum grid of  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2-1) (black histogram) and  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3-2) (red histogram) for 40 random positions around the core. Shown are the two-Gaussian fits (blue curves) and one-Gaussian fits (green curves) to the  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2-1) line. The vertical line is  $\\mathrm{V_{lsr}} = 5.2 \\mathrm{km s^{-1}}$ . The blue star shows the spectrum for the position of the central protostar."
