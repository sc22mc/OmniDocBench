The presented approach involved constructing a multilayer perceptron architecture with fully connected layers. There are two hidden layers, the first with eight neurons and the second with four neurons. This architecture is used in all the experiments except for the one in which different NN sizes are compared (Section III-B). Each node is implemented with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, while the output layers employ a sigmoid function. The final step involved converting the output to a binary value using a threshold of 0.5. During the training process, we implemented early stopping with a patience of 5 to prevent overfitting and identify the optimal number of epochs necessary for the training."

Its functionality involves identifying an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the separation between data points associated with distinct classes. In our implementation of SVM, we employed the sklearn library [36], which offers a robust set of tools for machine learning in Python.
