In the present investigation, we introduce and study the geometric properties of a class of analytic functions, associated with a parabolic region majorly lying in the left- half plane. Further we establish radius and majorization results for the class under study with pictorial illustrations of some of its special cases. Also we derive some sufficient conditions for the class under consideration.",

Assume  $S\\subset A$  to be the class of univalent functions.
