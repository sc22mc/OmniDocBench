That is, a fit on log scale to the 10 surrounding days. The younger age groups are usually more active, and we therefore expect the growth rate of outbreaks starting in those groups to converge to the dominant eigenvalue faster. This turns out to be the case, and the convergence consistently happens within the first three weeks, see Figure 1 for an illustration. It is clear that an outbreak starting in a less active group will take longer to find the equilibrium state than one starting in the more active group. It is also clear that a higher growth rate leads to faster convergence. Neither of these facts are surprising, but the scale that it happens on is significant. It shows that waiting three weeks before measuring the growth rate is enough to negate this non- equilibrium effect, and it is therefore safe to estimate the growth rate at this point. This effect does not depend on the infectiousness, only the spacing between the eigenvalues as illustrated in Equation (6). Note also that the difference between 10 and 20 points is only a slight shift in the estimated growth rate."
