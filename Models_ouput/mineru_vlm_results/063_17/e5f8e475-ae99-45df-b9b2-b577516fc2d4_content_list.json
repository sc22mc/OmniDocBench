        "text": "This holds for  $p = 7$  and  $g = 3$  . The remaining two cases  $- g^{2}\\pm g + 1 = 0$  are equivalent because  $- g^{2} + g + 1 = 0$  if and only if  $- g^{- 2} - g^{- 1} + 1 = 0$  .In other words, we only need to consider the equality  $g^{2} = g + 1$  over  $\\mathbb{F}_p$  . Such a primitive root  $g$  is called a Fibonacci primitive root modulo  $p$  , as the golden ratio  $\\phi_{gr}$  satisfying  $\\phi_{gr}^{2} =$ $\\phi_{gr} + 1$  .The primes  $p$  such that  $\\mathbb{F}_p$  has a Fibonacci primitive root is the sequence A003147: 5, 11, 19, 31, 41, 59, 61, 71, 79, 109, ... on OEIS [Slo]. Consequently, we have  $N(p,(p - 1) / 2) > 0$  if and only if  $\\mathbb{F}_p$  has a Fibonacci primitive root. On the other hand, the order  $|H|$  of the subgroup  $H = \\langle - 1,2\\rangle$  is an even integer. It follows that  $\\begin{array}{r}\\ell_0 = \\frac{p - 1}{|H|} \\end{array}$  must divide  $\\frac{p - 1}{2}$  . By Proposition 5.3, we see that Equation  $②$  is solvable over  $\\mathbb{F}_p$  if  $\\mathbb{F}_p$  has a Fibonacci primitive root. In this case, there exists a solution  $(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{F}_p^2$  such that  $xy\\neq 0$  and thus Conjecture  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  holds.",

        "text": "On a related issue, for the valid cases in Conjecture  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  established above we would like to know how many prime numbers  $p$  are there such that the subgroup  $H$  generated by  $- 1$  and 2 has the given index  $\\ell_0$  in  $\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times$ . This question can be viewed as a generalization of the Artin's primitive root conjecture. It is shown in [Mur91] Theorem 1] that there are infinitely many primes  $p$  such that the index  $[\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times :H] = \\ell_0$  under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). Assuming GRH, we conclude from Corollary  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  that there are infinitely many prime numbers  $p$  with  $\\ell_0$  satisfying conditions in Theorem 5.2 and therefore, the size of optimal CACs of prime lengths is equal to  $M(p,\\ell_0)$  for infinitely many primes  $p$ .",
