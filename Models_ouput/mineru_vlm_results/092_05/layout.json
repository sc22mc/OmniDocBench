For this reason, we do not assume its maximum duration when designing the sensor node architecture. If we rely on sensor node components to generate the wakeup signal, there is an upper limit on rest time. If the PMFC were to require long resting periods, the storage could become fully discharged while powering the components required for wakeup signal generation (e.g., timers, voltage monitors), preventing the node from ever waking up again. Because of this reason, we bring the node out of rest state through an external wakeup signal, which we also harvest in a passive wakeup approach. The energy harvested from this external signal is used to bootstrap the input power and sensing path (IPSP—Section III- C2), which is the section of the sensor node allowing power to flow from the PMFC to the harvesting circuitry [35]. In this way, the sensor node can still successfully wakeup even if its storage becomes fully depleted. This technique ensures no upper bound on rest time, although it requires the external infrastructure to generate the wakeup signal. Depending on the application, we can rely on self- powered IR sensors, PV panels, or passive wakeup radios for passive wakeup [36]. If optimal rest times are short enough and compatible with an onboard wakeup generation, passive wakeup could act as a fail- safe to revive nodes discharged during rest."
