RF is an ensemble- based learning method that combines multiple decision trees to produce robust and accurate classification or regression results. RF can be employed for plant disease detection to classify hyperspectral data into healthy or diseased classes [265], [266]. kNN is a nonparametric- based algorithm for classification and regression tasks. For plant disease detection, it compares the plant sample with its neighboring features to identify whether the sample is infected or not [266], [267]. SAM is an algorithm that classifies hyperspectral imagery based on the angle between the spectra. Based on the spectral angle difference, pixels are classified into categories such as healthy or diseased plants [268]. Maximum likelihood classification is a probabilistic classifier that assigns a pixel to the class that has the maximum likelihood. It can be used for plant disease detection to classify hyperspectral data into categories like healthy or diseased [269]. On the other hand, PLSR is a statistical technique that can model the relationship between hyperspectral data and plant disease severity [270]. Dirichlet aggregation regression uses Dirichlet distributions for modeling compositional data, and it can also be used to model the relationship between hyperspectral data and plant disease severity [271]. Logistic regression is used for cases with binary classification, such as disease or no disease detection [272], whereas multiple linear regression can provide multiple classes classification [273]."

Over the past decades, deep learning algorithms have improved image classification performance, object detection, and so on. Recently, remote sensing image processing algorithms have also been developed to process complex images such as multispectral and hyperspectral images. Some popular algorithms are CNN [276], deep belief networks [277], stacked autoencoder [278], and so on. Table IV compares different models used in image processing techniques for hyperspectral imaging."
