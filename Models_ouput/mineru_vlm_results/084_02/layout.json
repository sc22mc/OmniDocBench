Finally, we present preliminary experimental results obtained in a real networking scenario, where we investigate the current performance of MARLIN and compare it to the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in handling a file transfer task."

The agent interfaces with a custom transport protocol, presented in Section III via Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) in a nonblocking, bi- directional fashion, as shown in Figure 1. The frequency of action taking depends on the latest Smoothed Round- Trip Time (SRTT) estimated for the path. The reward function is shaped as a strictly negative reward to intrinsically encode the principle that every step taken to transfer the information is a step too much."

It is inconvenient for the agent to overfit its trajectories on a fixed amount of bytes to transfer, or a fixed episode length, such that it will try to find a terminal state at any cost in a certain number of timesteps. Instead, we aim at designing RL agents able to work on \"crowded\" links and achieve high channel utilization independently from the volume of data transferred during training. For such reason, training is based on infinite- horizon tasks, never encountering a terminal state and following the Partial Episode Bootstrapping (PEB) principles for infinite- horizon training presented in [12]."

Packets in modern networks are often transmitted a few milliseconds apart, sometimes microseconds. At the same time, running Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to update the model during training, or even simply computing a new action, can take up a significantly greater amount of time. As a consequence, the environment might have already changed significantly by the time the action is taken, potentially making it obsolete or, even, wrong. This has been identified as one of the main reasons why it is hard to maintain the performance achieved in a simulated environment after moving to a real- world deployment [15]."
