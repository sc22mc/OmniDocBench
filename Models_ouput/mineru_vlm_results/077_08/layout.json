However, Timewarp in exploration mode (Algorithm 2) can be used as a validation tool to quickly verify exploration of the whole state space. Figure 6a shows that metastable states unexplored by MD and Timewarp MCMC can be found by the Timewarp exploration algorithm. We confirm the physical validity of these discovered states by running shorter MD trajectories in their vicinity (see Appendix B.5). As with 2AA, we again report the speedup factors for Timewarp relative to MD in Figure 5b,d.

Figure 6c shows that Timewarp MCMC also leads to a potential energy distribution that matches MD very closely. In contrast, Timewarp exploration discovers all metastable states (even ones that MD misses), but has less accurate free energy plots. It also has a potential energy distribution that is slightly too high relative to MD and Timewarp MCMC."

We showed that Timewarp used with an MH correction can accelerate asymptotically unbiased sampling on many unseen dipeptides, allowing faster computation of equilibrium expectation values. Although this acceleration was only possible for a minority of the tetrapeptides we considered, we showed that Timewarp used without the MH correction explores the metastable states of both dipeptides and tetrapeptides much faster than standard MD. This provides a promising method to quickly validate if MD simulations have visited all metastable states. Although further work needs to be done to scale Timewarp to larger, more interesting biomolecules, this work clearly demonstrates the ability of deep learning algorithms to leverage transferability to accelerate the MD sampling problem."
