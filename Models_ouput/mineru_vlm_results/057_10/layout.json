Our approach to automatically caption bug recording provides a semantic bridge between textual and visual bug reports. In detail, CAPdroid complement the existing methods, as the first process of these downstream tasks is usually to employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract the representations of bug steps into a structural grammar, such as action, object, and position, which can be automatically extracted by our approach in visual bug recording."

Results in the usefulness evaluation in Section IV have demonstrated the usefulness of our approach in generating high- quality descriptions for Android bug recordings to help developers with bug replay in real- world practice. Supporting bug recordings of different platforms (e.g., iOS, Web) can bring analogous benefits to developers [60]. As the actions from different platforms exert almost no difference, and our approach is purely image- based and non- intrusive, it can be generalized to caption bug recordings for other platforms with reasonable customization efforts to our approach. In the future, we will conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the performance of CAPdroid in supporting those platforms."

These models showed their advantage in video summarization, but it was hard to achieve the goal of generating multiple concrete captions with their temporal locations from the video (a.k.a dense video captioning). Intuitively, dense video captioning can be decomposed into two phases: event segmentation and event description. Existing methods tackled these two sub- problems using event proposal and captioning modules, and exploited two ways to combine them for dense video captioning. We borrowed the two- phase idea to generate a natural language description for GUI recording, denoting events as user actions."

Some of the following works [77], [78] aimed to enrich the event representations by context modeling, event- level relationships, or multi- modal feature fusion, enabling more accurate event segmentation. However, these methods were designed for general videos which contain more natural scenes like human, plants, animals, etc. Different from those videos, our GUI recordings belonged to artificial artifacts with different image motions (i.e., GUI rendering). While some previous studies worked on domain- specific GUI recordings, they focused on high- level GUI understanding, such as duplicate bug detection [60], GUI animation linting [79], [80], etc. In contrast, we focused on the fine- grained user actions in the GUI recording. To analyse and segment actions from the GUI recording, many record- and- replay tools were developed based on different types of information, including the runtime information [81] and app artifacts [82], [84], [17]. Nurmuradov et al. [83] introduced an advanced lightweight tool to record user interactions by displaying the device screen in a web browser. Feng et al. [4], [17] proposed an image processing method to extract the keyframes from the recording and mapped them to states in the GUI transitions graph to replay the execution trace. However, they required the installation of underlying frameworks, or instrumenting apps which is too heavy and time- consuming. Bernal et al. [8] implemented a deep learning- based tool named V2S to detect and classify user actions from specific recordings, a high- resolution recording with a default Android touch indicator. But more than 32% of end- users cannot meet that requirement in real- world bug reports according to our analysis in Section II- A. In contrast, considering the diversity of touch indicators in the general"
