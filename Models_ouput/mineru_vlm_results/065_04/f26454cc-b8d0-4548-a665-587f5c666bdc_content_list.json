This line traces only one velocity component that is associated with the high- density material. On the other hand, as already mentioned,  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) shows two velocity components in their profiles. The brightest component is the one close to the velocity of the  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) line, and it hence arises from the high- density material. The fainter component of  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) can appear on the red or blue side of the stronger component depending on the location in the cloud. In total, there are three different velocity components, the main one at  $5.2\\mathrm{km / s}$  (in all panels on all  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) spectra locations), a lower velocity component seen in the northwestern panels, and a higher velocity component seen in the southwestern panels. In the first two rows of Fig. 3 the faint component appears on the blue side, and in the two bottom rows of the spectrum grid it appears on the blue side of the stronger component.",

The multiple velocity components of  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) along the line of sight appear to merge from east to west (moving toward the position of the protostar).  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) is a lower density tracer than  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2); these fainter velocity components, seen only in the former tracer, are likely additional, nearby low- density filamentary clouds along the line of sight. The core envelope then appears to be found in the correspondence of the merger of these structures. In the following subsections, we discuss the maps of the kinematics parameters for each tracer individually.",

With the  $26\\%$  error on the velocity gradient, we get a final relative error of  $49\\%$  for the value of the mass accretion rate.
