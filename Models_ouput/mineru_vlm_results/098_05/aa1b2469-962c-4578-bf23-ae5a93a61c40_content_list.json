These restoration errors resemble mistakes humans would make when memorizing the same text. This suggests that, like humans, the model selectively emphasizes or neglects certain parts of the information during the memorization based on its own understanding. It is also consistent with Peng et al. (2023): the stronger the LLM, the fewer it needs to memorize, and thus the smaller the memorization effort. This is similar to human learning: knowledgeable individuals tend to learn more effortlessly, while those with limited knowledge often rely on rote memorization to acquire new information.",

According to Table 3, in contrast to compressing normal texts which can be well restored, compressing and restoring less common texts (i.e., random texts) becomes very challenging, reflected by much worse loss and BLEU scores. All these results strongly support our intuition that an LLM's memorization pattern is highly similar to humans.",
