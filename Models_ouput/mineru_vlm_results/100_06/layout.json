Our findings indicate that the proposed BoT with Boosting mechanism 1). obtains competitive problem- solving rates in most datasets without human annotations; 2). is capable of reaching a new state- of- the- art on GSM8K and AQuA when provided with CoT examples. However, experimental results also demonstrate that BoT heavily relies on experience, thus is sensitive to the ability of LLMs."
