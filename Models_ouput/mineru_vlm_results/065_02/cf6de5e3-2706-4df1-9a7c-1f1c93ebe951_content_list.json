[2021] studied 62 low- mass Class 0 and I protostars in nearby  $(< 450\\mathrm{pc})$  star- forming regions with the orientations of the magnetic fields on  $0.05 - 0.5\\mathrm{pc}$  scales. They suggest that the outflows are likely to be misaligned with B- fields by 50 degrees in 3D space. While Hull & Zhang (2019) used Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations with spatial resolutions of up to  $\\sim 100$  au, and conclude that magnetic fields and outflows are randomly aligned in low- mass protostellar cores. The discrepancy between simulations and observations can be due to the limitations of the simulation setup. As an example, Lee et al. (2017) applied an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation when in reality non- ideal MHD effect might be important (Wurster 2021).",

(2019a) used polarimetric observations of the dust thermal emission at  $1.4\\mathrm{THz}$  obtained with the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) telescope to investigate the magnetic field properties at the core scales toward IRAS15398. The authors found a uniform magnetic field consistent with the large- scale field derived from optical observations (Franco & Alves 2015). They suggested the core experienced a magnetically driven collapse and the core inherited the B- field morphology from the parental cloud during its evolution. The field lines pinch inward toward the central object, leading to the characteristic hourglass shape that is predicted by models of magnetically driven collapse. They showed that the mean direction of the magnetic field is aligned with the large- scale B- field and with the direction of outflow. Their prediction for a magnetic field strength of  $\\mathrm{B} = 78\\mu \\mathrm{G}$  is expected to be accurate within a factor of two. They calculated the mass- to- flux ratio,  $\\lambda = 0.95$  which means that the core is in a state of transition between supercritical and subcritical states.",

In Sect. 4 we analyze the observed line profiles of  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) and  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) emission lines. The results are summarized in Sect. 5.",
