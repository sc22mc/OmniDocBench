Examples include farm machinery automation technologies, such as machinery guided navigation systems [18] and path planning algorithms [19]. Field boundaries may also be used to monitor in- field application rates of additive materials recorded from machinery [20]. This is relevant at a time when the EU aims to halve pesticide use by 2030 under the farm- to- fork strategy [21]. Proximal sensing applications on agricultural machinery [14], [22], [23] may play a role in satisfying PA data requirements [5], but the data must first be spatially classified. The required resolution is application dependent, however, isolating machinery data to inside a field geometric boundary is an essential step prior to processing agricultural machinery data."

Fig. 1 presents an overview of the algorithm's approach to solving for field geometric boundaries. The method is evaluated with geolocation and power take- off (PTO) digital event data obtained from a full harvesting season on machinery operated by a grass silage contractor. Contractors will often visit multiple adjacent fields in a single day, where they continue to activate the PTO, despite traversing into a new field. In the context of this article, a \"job site\" is a recorded work episode of the operating machinery performing a task in one or several fields of the same crop type. A work episode indicates that the machine is operating and that the PTO shaft is"
