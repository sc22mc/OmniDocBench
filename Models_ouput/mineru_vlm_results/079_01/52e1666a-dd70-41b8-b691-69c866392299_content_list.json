        "text": "ABSTRACT. In 2015, I. Soprunov and A. Zvavitch have shown how to use the Bernstein- Khovanskii- Kushnirenko theorem to derive non- negativity of a certain bilinear form  $F_{\\Delta}$ , defined on (pairs of) convex bodies. Together with C. Saroglou, they proved non- negativity of  $F_{K}$  characterizes simplices, among all polytopes. It is conjectured the characterization further holds among all convex bodies. Towards this conjecture, several necessary conditions on  $K$  (for non- negativity of  $F_{K}$ ), were derived. We give a new necessary condition, expressed with isoperimetric ratios, which provides a further step towards a (conjectural) characterization of simplices among a certain subclass of convex bodies.",

Here  $|K|_{n}$  denotes the Lebesgue measure of  $K$  (its volume), and  $|\\partial K|_{n - 1}$  its surface area (the  $(n - 1)$  - Hausdorff measure of its topological boundary). A classical result in convex geometry, the isoperimetric inequality, states that Euclidean balls minimize this ratio, and are the only minimizers. On the other side, the isoperimetric ratio can be arbitrarily large. However, note this ratio is not affine invariant. Following K. Ball (see [Ba, Theorem 2]), consider instead the affine invariant quantity:",
