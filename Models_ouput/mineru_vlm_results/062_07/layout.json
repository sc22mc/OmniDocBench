CARLA is based on a server- client system, in which the server is responsible for running the simulations including the calculation of physics, weather conditions, collision detection and sensor readings. It operates on the OpenDRIVE specification [58] for defining junctions, traffic lights, etc, and is used by CARLA for simulating independent agents, such as other cars and pedestrians. This makes CARLA ideal for creating complex scenarios and realistic driving conditions for our tests."

By placing these sensors in an autonomous car and initiating its navigation in the virtual environment, we were able to create a very large dataset for evaluating our algorithms. In the future, we plan to assess the AR visualization effectiveness, with respect to reaction time and awareness increase, in a real environment with a driver manually controlling a vehicle."
