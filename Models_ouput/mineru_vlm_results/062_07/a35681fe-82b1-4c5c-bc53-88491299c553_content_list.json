The direction of the vehicle specifies which part of the scene in the field of view is in front of the vehicle and is used as as parameter, in addition to saliency mapping, for the segmentation of the point cloud. The more critical regions are the ones that lie within the limits of the road. A segmentation example is illustrated in Fig. 5",

CARLA is based on a server- client system, in which the server is responsible for running the simulations including the calculation of physics, weather conditions, collision detection and sensor readings. It operates on the OpenDRIVE specification [58] for defining junctions, traffic lights, etc, and is used by CARLA for simulating independent agents, such as other cars and pedestrians. This makes CARLA ideal for creating complex scenarios and realistic driving conditions for our tests.",

Clients can connect and request changes to almost any element in the world being essential for the creation of scenarios. They also receive sensor data and manage input to the vehicle controlled by the user. CARLA supports a wide range of sensor suites with extensive configurability to its intrinsic parameters. In our work, we use a LiDAR sensor on top of the vehicle and a monocular RGB camera, placed in the front part of the car, for simulated data collection. By placing these sensors in an autonomous car and initiating its navigation in the virtual environment, we were able to create a very large dataset for evaluating our algorithms. In the future, we plan to assess the AR visualization effectiveness, with respect to reaction time and awareness increase, in a real environment with a driver manually controlling a vehicle.",
