If a higher accuracy was ever to be required, printable reference electrodes [37] can easily be added to the sensor, without any additional energy expenditure. The two EIS terminals consist of two electrodes, which are also used for collecting the energy required to execute the EIS measurements. Our novel approach ensures that the PMFC acts both as an energy source and a biosensor for our application: in the first case, the PMFC electrodes are connected to the dc/dc, in the second to the EIS AFE."

First, it turns the power flow on/off from the PMFC to the dc/dc input, to either harvest energy from the cell or to unload it to ensure cell recovery.

After that, we moved on to analyzing the time development of the impedance spectra of active and inactive PMFCs: with this experiment, we confirm that the impedance spectrum of a PMFC varies significantly both from day to day and from active and inactive plants. These significant changes in EIS results can be tracked to more than just common MFC parameters, such as biofilm formation, but also to plant health and status. We executed this first set of EIS measurements with a reference potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302 N) for three consecutive days. These first EIS measurements also allowed us to set up the MAX30134's measurement range for PMFCs. We then validated the MAX30134's capabilities in measuring a PMFC's impedance spectrum by comparing its measurements to the reference potentiostat and in terms of low- power energy consumption by measuring its energy consumption during a prototype EIS sweep. As a last step, we estimated the energy consumption of the atomic tasks of the application scenario we considered: message transmission and EIS measurement. This allowed us to dimension the energy storage element required for this test case and confirm the feasibility of a simple monitoring application based on this node."
