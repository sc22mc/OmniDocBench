This phenomenon is strictly related to the poses experienced during the acquisition, compounded by the noise surrounding the BMSB pixels, such as blur or overexposure. Despite the dataset comprising a diverse range of BMSB samples, certain poses and lighting/blurriness conditions are more frequent than others. Also, since the dataset consists of images captured by a drone operating according to an autonomous protocol, characterizing the entire range of possibilities is extremely challenging. As a result, the networks were able to detect BMSB instances that presented limited variation in pose and color appearance, thereby minimizing FP. However, instances significantly affected by noise were occasionally missed. Both YOLOv9 and YOLOv10- X achieve interesting performance representing a true step ahead of the predecessor, YOLOv5.

This represents a predictable outcome due to the limited size of the BMSB with respect to the entire image. For monitoring purposes, recognizing all instances inside the frame, i.e., achieving high recall, is more important than accurately contouring a bug, i.e., achieving high IoU. However, it noteworthy that both YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 demonstrate improved IoU values between prediction and ground truth, suggesting a clear enhancement with previous releases. Moreover, in comparison with the results in [20] where entire images are simply resized and fed to the model, the current implementation of the slicing mechanism allows a boost in the performance, specifically in the recall. Indeed, image slicing prevents information losses since it retains every pixel of the original image."

We employed the Kennard- Stone algorithm [37] on principal component (PC) scores to select these spectra. Then, we divided the images into training and test sets for model development and validation, respectively. Our classification approach focused on modeling the spectral information contained in the HSI images and identifying the relevant spectral regions to discriminate BMSB from vegetal backgrounds. To do this, we used the soft partial least squares- discriminant analysis (Soft PLS- DA) algorithm, coupled with sparse- based methods for spectral variable selection (s- Soft PLS- DA) [38]. This allowed us to build effective classification models tailored to our dataset."
