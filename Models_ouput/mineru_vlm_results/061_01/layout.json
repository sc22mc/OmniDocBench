They occasionally experienced an outburst and spent most of their time in quiescence. During an outburst, the X- ray spectral and timing properties usually changes dramatically on a timescale of days to months (Miyamoto et al. 1995; Remillard & McClintock 2006; Done et al. 2007; Belloni & Motta 2016). So different spectral states are classified based on the X- ray spectral and timing properties. The two main spectral states are hard and soft states. The accretion flow in the soft state is thought to be the geometrically thin disk (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), which is characterised by the multi- temperature black body X- ray spectrum and very low level short term X- ray variability. The X- ray spectra of the hard state are dominated by the inverse Comptonization scattering of the hot corona. A part of the hard X- ray illuminates the accretion disk and then produces a reflection component, which is characterised by the fluorescent iron K"

Later on, more comprehensive analysis of the LFQPOs has been performed with the observations of H1743- 322 (Ingram et al. 2016, 2017). Both the iron line energy and the reflection fraction are found modulated with the QPO phase. This is taken as strong evidence supporting the Lense- Thirring precession model. In recent analysis about QPO phase- resolved spectroscopy, Nathan et al. (2022) detected a significant modulation of the reflection fraction in GRS 1915+105, which indicates that the inner accretion disk geometry changes with QPO phase."
