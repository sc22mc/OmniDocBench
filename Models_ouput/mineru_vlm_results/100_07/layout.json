As Llama2 is weaker, BoT is unable to benefit from its analysis to perform the experience- driven iteration process, which is particularly shown by Fig. 3 (a). When provided with valid success cases, i.e., 5- shots, BoT, through progressive refinement, can still help Llama2 to solve more problems than the baseline even though the improvement is limited."
