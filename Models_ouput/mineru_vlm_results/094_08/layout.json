While the use of ML and DL has enabled the detection of plant diseases and classification, it involves several steps, such as noise reduction from the background, labeling, data augmentation, data splitting, feature extraction, and training. This may take considerable resources. To overcome the cost of using ML and DL, the use of transfer learning is now being employed. This involves the use of pretrained models on a large dataset for new datasets. Some of the pretrained models include AlexNet, VGG, and GoogleNet. The pretrained model comprises a large number of parameters that require fine- tuning. Table II provides a summary of various ML techniques."

They are less accessible to small- scale farmers and regions with limited resources, and their accuracy depends on high- quality samples and stringent protocols. Moreover, they employ destructive sampling and cannot distinguish between viable and dead DNA, which will likely result in some false positives. In contrast, image processing is more cost- effective, noninvasive, nondestructive, and suitable for real- time field monitoring, making it accessible and practical for small- scale farmers. However, it may not match the accuracy and specificity of molecular methods, especially for early stage or visually indistinct diseases, and can be influenced by environmental factors. Combining both methods can provide a comprehensive solution for effective disease management in ginger."

Hence, the combination of ML and IoT for agricultural purposes has been explored in [86], [87], and [88]. The AIoT techniques can offer tremendous benefits to ginger farmers. Unlike the use of only ML techniques that rely on the use of historical datasets for disease detection, the application of AIoT can enable proactive monitoring based on environmental conditions. Early warning systems can be implemented to generate alerts or notifications when conditions conducive to the development of ginger diseases are detected. This involves the development of predictive models that leverage historical data on ginger diseases, environmental conditions, and crop management practices to forecast disease outbreaks with real- time data. By deploying AIoT technologies for ginger disease detection, farmers can proactively monitor their crops, identify disease outbreaks early, and implement timely interventions to mitigate crop losses and improve yield and quality."

Automated disease detection systems can enable early intervention and targeted management strategies, ultimately improving crop health and productivity. However, several challenges need to be addressed to realize the full potential of AI in ginger cultivation. These include the need for large, annotated datasets, robust model generalization across different environmental conditions and disease severity, and user- friendly deployment of AI solutions for farmers in resource- limited settings. The challenges of deployment of emerging techniques for the detection of diseases in ginger farming are discussed as follows."
