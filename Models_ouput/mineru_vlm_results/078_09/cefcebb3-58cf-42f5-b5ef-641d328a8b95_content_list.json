The restated symplectic algebra provided in the quasi- classical limit is, de facto, inspired from Polymer Quantum Mechanics when the basic commutation relation is expanded for a small lattice step. We have shown in detail how the picture of an EU properly arises from the implementation of our dynamical scheme to the positively- curved isotropic Universe. The relevance of our restated cosmological dynamics consisted in the possibility to have a finite volume limit in the distant past of our Universe without any fine- tuning of the initial conditions, but as a natural and general feature of the modified symplectic algebra, phenomenologically similar to a modified gravity approach. We discussed in detail the different Universe phases in the proposed scheme, with particular emphasis on the possibility to have an inflationary de Sitter period that is well reconnected to the subsequent radiation dominated era, where most part of the actual Universe morphology is determined via Baryogenesis, Nucleosynthesis, and structure formation [2].",

We constructed the Hamiltonian for each Fourier mode of the quantum scalar field, which corresponded to that of a time- dependent harmonic oscillator (as in the standard spectrum case) plus a small perturbation controlled by the value of the cut- off parameter. We then performed a suitable perturbation theory procedure to calculate the modified expectation value of the squared Fourier harmonics of the Mukhanov- Sasaki variable constructed from the inflaton field, hence computing the corrections to the primordial perturbation Spectrum. Finally, we carefully analyzed the constraints and the proper initial conditions we have to impose on our model in order for the correction to the standard spectrum to live in an observational window for future experiments on the microwave background temperature distribution [2].",
