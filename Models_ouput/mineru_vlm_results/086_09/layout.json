The pathogen is viral in nature, and the pathogen is called genus Potyvirus (PVY). The virus belongs to the Potyviridae family, and it is known to be one of the top ten plant- destructive diseases around the globe. As the pathogen is viral in nature, different strains are available, and the symptoms can vary from mosaic leaf pattern with discoloration in the leaves (caused by the PVYO strain), leaf, and tuber spots that are necrotic (caused by PVYN and PVYTN strain) [129]. A survey from Polder et al. [129] showed that every year, Potato virus Y causes approximately 20 million euros to be lost for Dutch farmers [129]. Another fungal pathogen named late blight disease is also common in potatoes. The fungal pathogen is called Phytophthora infestans. The symptoms include the leaves appearing water- soaked and dark- colored lesions. With time, the lesions on the leaves become brown or black and eventually dry out. The lesions can also appear on the potatoes [130]."

This disease is also considered a widespread disease in the oil seed crops, which can substantially impact the yield [131]. The most common symptoms of blackleg are the lodging and premature death of the stem. Dark lesions with pale centers develop in the stem, branches, and pods. The crops/fruits appear black in color [132]. Downy mildew is also a popular oil seed disease. It is caused by a fungus called Hyaloperonospora parasitica (Gaum.) Goker. The symptoms include irregular development of leaves, where the upper surface appears to have yellow necrotic lesions and the bottom surface of the leaves has white- gray looking mycelium [133]."

In some instances, severe infections can lead the leaf to turn chlorotic and then to necrotic [134]. The yellow mosaic diseases are transmitted through whiteflies and mostly affect the leguminous crops [135]. Soybean anthracnose is caused by a fungus called Colletotrichum. The symptoms appear as dark, irregular spots on the stems, pods, and cotyledons. The leaves appear to have necrotic laminar veins, which cause precocious defoliation. Soybean anthracose can also open the immature pods, germinate grains prematurely, and sometimes even rot the pods [136]."
