Chemicals that contain mancozeb, chlorothalonil, thiophanate methyl, or copper-based compounds are sprayed on ginger plants to reduce the impact of fungal infections. Another chemical control is the use of pesticides to manage insect vectors that can transmit viral diseases. The use of chemical control can provide immediate relief from pest and disease pressures; however, this can harm the environment and soil health [52]."

However, this is a long-term strategy. Finding disease-resistant rhizomes in ginger necessitates the use of an effective and trustworthy disease-screening technique. For instance, selection methods for locating resistance to bacterial wilt in ginger plants were investigated in [49]. This includes pseudostem inoculation, rhizome inoculation, soil inoculation, and an in vitro method. The result of the study shows that the soil inoculation method outperformed the other methods due to its simplicity and large-scale adoption in a short time for bacterial wilt resistance in ginger."

This involves the use of sensors to monitor the soil condition to prevent overwatering and also ensure ginger plants receive the right amount of resources. This helps reduce diseases, such as rhizome rots. In addition, robotics are used for precision spraying of fungicides, pesticides, weeding, planting, and even harvesting. They provide increased accuracy and efficiency of disease management operations while reducing labor costs. This promotes sustainable farming practices by minimizing the environmental impact of agriculture through precise application of inputs. The drawback is the initial investment, which can be a barrier for small-scale farmers."

Targets RNA viruses by converting RNA to cDNA, crucial for detecting RNA-based pathogens, such as ginger mosaic virus (GMV) in ginger."
