Also, the topmost sheet of the ferromagnetically arranged Mn moments should strongly couple with the topological surface states (TSS), albeit a thorough spectroscopic investigation of the surface magnetism is still pending. As a result, a much higher  $T_{\\mathrm{QAH}} = 1.4\\mathrm{K}$  is achieved in  $\\mathrm{MnBi_2Te_4}$  [20].

        "text": "Yet, the potential of the other MBT  $\\mathit{TL}$  for a further substantial increase of  $T_{\\mathrm{QAH}}$  is strong: Increasing  $n$  weakens the interlayer AFM coupling so that FM properties gradually develop. Indeed, most studies report a complex metamagnetic behavior in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10 [21- 27], but a clear FM state only for  $n\\geq 3$  [22, 23, 28]. Already metamagnetic MnBi4Te7 hosts the QAHE up to several degree kelvin in the bulk regime [29]. This experimental realization of a QAHE device out of a bulk crystal required technically challenging but feasible efforts to attain the charge neutrality condition [29]. Consequently, envisioning this clear, technical realization path once an appropriate bulk crystal exists, we focus here on the next obvious step, namely to strengthen the FM properties of MBT  $\\mathit{TL}$  .Our synthesis endeavors culminate in the robust FM order in MnBi6Te10 (i.e. already for  $n = 2$  ), an intrinsic magnetic TI [19] and QAHE candidate [30].",

The clear FM characteristics seemingly contradict the weak AFM coupling anticipated by our density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the atomically ordered compound. This disagreement is resolved by including the experimentally determined Mn substoichiometry and Mn/Bi site intermixing into account. Our calculations pinpoint that the magnetic coupling can be tuned towards ferromagnetism by appropriate intermixing already in MnBi4Te7 and even MnBi2Te4. Considering the intermixing patterns in our MnBi6Te10 samples and those reported showing no ferromagnetism, we rationalize their differing magnetic behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered intermixing can accomplish a robust FM order and, there fore, is the key towards enhanced QAHE properties in the MBT  $\\mathit{TL}$  family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.",

Both features are also present in Mn0.85Bi10Te4 [32] and Mn0.75Bi14.17Te7 [26].
