The clear FM characteristics seemingly contradict the weak AFM coupling anticipated by our density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the atomically ordered compound. This disagreement is resolved by including the experimentally determined Mn substoichiometry and Mn/Bi site intermixing into account. Our calculations pinpoint that the magnetic coupling can be tuned towards ferromagnetism by appropriate intermixing already in MnBi4Te7 and even MnBi2Te4. Considering the intermixing patterns in our MnBi6Te10 samples and those reported showing no ferromagnetism, we rationalize their differing magnetic behavior. Our results demonstrate that carefully engineered intermixing can accomplish a robust FM order and, there "
