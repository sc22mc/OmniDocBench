Parametric representations of the scenarios (a) adaptive cruise control (ACC), \"The Ego follows the Co on a straight road,\" (b) lane keeping (LK, \"The Ego follows a curved road\"), and (c) ACC&LK (\"The Ego follows the Co on a curved road.\"). The center of the lanes in (b) and (c) follows a polynomial of  $3^{\\mathrm{rd}}$  degree. In (a) and (c), the Co starts from its initial  $x$ -coordinate  $x_{\\mathrm{CO}}$  with a velocity of  $v_{\\mathrm{CO}}$ . After a time of  $t_{v}$ $C_0$ , it decelerates with  $a_{\\mathrm{CO}}$  for  $t_{a}$ $C_0$ . The Ego's initial velocity  $v_{\\mathrm{Ego}}$  is varied in all scenarios. More details about the variation are given in Section IV-A. As a result of the execution, evaluation metrics are calculated: the Ego's minimum deceleration  $a_{\\mathrm{min}}$ , the Ego's maximum lateral position  $p_{\\mathrm{lat}}$  max, and the vehicles' minimum distance  $d_{\\mathrm{min}}$ ."

Considering the three functional scenarios in Fig. 2 it is desirable that data from the scenarios adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane keeping (LK) allow to predict the scenario ACC&LK's outcomes. However, the different logical scenarios and evaluation metrics stand against such a transfer. To enable the transfer of data across different functional (and hence logical) scenarios, metamodels must get more information than just concrete scenarios and evaluation metrics. To implement this, we propose scenario embeddings.",
