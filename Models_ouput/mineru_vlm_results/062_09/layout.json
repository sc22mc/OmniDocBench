In particular, our work focuses on information sharing among vehicles about encountered obstacles, such as potholes and bumps, through a centralized server. When a vehicle identifies an unexpected (i.e., unregistered) obstacle, the vehicle sends a request to the server and after further inspection, the new potential obstacle is either discarded or added to the database. Vehicles may also send information regarding already known obstacles when they come across them. Such information includes the Global Positioning System (GPS) location, dimensions and geometrical characteristics in case the obstacle needs updating in the database, e.g. it has increased in size or has been fixed. Through this communication system, a driver can be warned about potential hazards that may not yet be in his field of view or they are obstructed by other objects and thus, increase his performance and decision- making abilities. We should clarify that our work does not focus on communication protocols and defence mechanisms against potential network attacks, but rather defines a solid framework describing the roles of each node and the information flow."

Thus, periodic updates are necessary for the long- term reliability of the pothole visualization component. As there is a need for periodical evaluation of the objects in the server database and update in the case of changes, we assign a shape- and geometry- based descriptor at each obstacle, so that it is characterized by a unique representative signature. Thus, every vehicle encountering the obstacle in a nearby range, calculates the descriptor of the obstacle's area. The new descriptor is then transmitted to the server and is used to confirm whether the information is up- to- date. In the case of a difference in the descriptor's value, an algorithm running in the server decides between keeping the old descriptor, updating it with the new one, or marking the obstacle as removed and deleting the entry from the database."

Since potholes are static and thus change only in shape, the similarity check is based only on the bounding box of the re- identified pothole. When the overlap of the bounding boxes is less than a threshold, the previous object is replaced by the new one. In our experiments we used a"
