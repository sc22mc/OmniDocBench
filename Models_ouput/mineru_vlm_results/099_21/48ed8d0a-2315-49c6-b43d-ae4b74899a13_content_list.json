Providing specific timeframes for each activity would make the plan more practical and easier to follow. The plan also does not consider potential constraints such as the feasibility of visiting multiple major attractions in a single day, which may not be realistic given factors like travel time, waiting lines, and the time needed to fully appreciate each site. The plan could also be more creative and personalized. For example, it could suggest less tourist, off- the- beaten- path attractions or activities that could provide a unique and memorable experience. Lastly, the plan does not provide any information on the budget, which is an essential aspect of trip planning. Including estimated costs for transportation, accommodation, meals, and entrance fees would make the plan more thorough and useful.",
