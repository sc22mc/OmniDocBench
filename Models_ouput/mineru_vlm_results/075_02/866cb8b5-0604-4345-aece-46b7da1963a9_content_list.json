On the other hand, Uhlhorn's version of Wigner's theorem [23] says that every bijective transformation preserving the orthogonality of rays in both directions is induced by a unitary or anti- unitary operator if  $\\dim H \\geq 3$ ; the assumption of bijectivity cannot be omitted if  $H$  is infinite- dimensional.

        "text": "In [13, 15], the non- bijective version of Wigner's theorem is extended on the Grassmannian of  $k$ - dimensional subspaces of  $H$  as follows: every (not necessarily bijective) transformation preserving the principal angles between subspaces is induced by a linear or conjugate- linear isometry if  $\\dim H \\neq 2k$ ; in the case when  $\\dim H = 2k$ , such a transformation can be also the composition of the orthocomplementary map and a transformation induced by a linear conjugate- linear isometry. Also, there is an extension of Uhlhorn's version. By [10, 21], every bijective transformation of the Grassmannian preserving the orthogonality relation in both directions is induced by a unitary or anti- unitary operator if  $\\dim H > 2k$  (the orthogonality relation is not defined if  $\\dim H < 2k$ , for the case when  $\\dim H = 2k$  the statement fails); as above, the bijectivity assumption cannot be dropped if  $H$  is infinite- dimensional. Various examples of Wigner- type theorems for Hilbert Grassmannians can be found in [8, 14, 17].",

Closed subspaces of a Hilbert space are called ortho- adjacent if they are adjacent and compatible. The compatibility of subspaces is equivalent to the commutativity of the corresponding projections. Note that the ortho- adjacency relation for anisotropic subspaces of sesquilinear forms is considered in [11, 20].",

The Grassmannian is partially ordered by the inclusion relation and every automorphism of this poset is induced by an invertible bounded linear or conjugate- linear operator [17, Theorem 3.17]. This is closely related to [21, Theorem 1.2] which states that every bijective transformation of  $\\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  preserving the orthogonality in both directions is induced by a unitary or anti- unitary operator. The orthocomplementary transformation of  $\\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  is adjacency and ortho- adjacency preserving; however, it reverses inclusions and does not preserve the orthogonality. Furthermore, there are bijective transformations of  $\\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  preserving the adjacency and ortho- adjacency in both directions and non- obtainable by unitary or anti- unitary operators and the possible composition with the orthocomplementary map. This is due to the existence of elements of  $\\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  whose intersection is of infinite codimension in each of them; such elements cannot be connected by a finite sequence, where consecutive elements are adjacent or ortho- adjacent.",
