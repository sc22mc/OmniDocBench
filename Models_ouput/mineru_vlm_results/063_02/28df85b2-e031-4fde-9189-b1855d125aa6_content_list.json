An optimal CAC are constructed in [LT05, Lev07] when  $n_2 = 1$  If  $n_2\\neq 1$  , it is proved in [FLs14] that an optimal CAC of length  $n$  can be constructed from an optimal CAC of length  $n_2$  . It is also proved in [FLs14] that an optimal CAC of a prime power length can be constructed if we know how to construct an optimal CAC of prime length provided that the prime  $p$  in question is a non- Wieferich prime. For other odd lengths or tight/equi- difference CACs, we refer to [Mom07] WF13 [LMSJ14] MM17 HLS] for the constructions. It turns out that CACs of prime lengths are the fundamental cases needed to be constructed. This naturally leads us to study CACs of prime lengths and weight 3.",
