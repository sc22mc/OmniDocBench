The PnL  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(r)$  is defined as the arithmetic mean of this difference for the two time points  $u = t$  and  $u = T$  The precisely same logic applies to the interpretation of  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(x)$  , only with  $r$  replaced by  $x$  . Finally, the PnL  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}$  (carry) intuitively should measure the change between the asset values  $A_{t}$  and  $A_{T}$  that is only due to time passing, without the effects of  $r$  and  $x$  Since the variables  $r$  and  $x$  change their values within the period  $(t,T]$  , one reasonable approach is to use an \"average\" of the variables  $r,x$  on the period  $(t,T]$  . Since we only have  $r,x$  available at the two time points  $t$  and  $T$  , a pragmatic idea to accomplish such average is to mix the possible pairs  $(r_u,x_s)$  for  $u,s\\in \\{t,T\\}$  in a way that is as \"neutral\" as possible. This is precisely what's done in the definition of  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}$  (carry).",

Clearly, an average that would take into account all time points  $u \\in (t,T]$  would be more desirable from a theoretical perspective. For instance, based on the multivariate It√¥ formula, under the assumption that  $\\{r_u\\}_{u \\in (t,T]}$  and  $\\{x_u\\}_{u \\in (t,T]}$  are realizations of semi- martingales, take values in  $\\mathbb{R}$  (i.e. are not function- valued), and under the assumption that  $r$  and  $x$  are independent, we obtain the decomposition",
