The left panel of Fig. 6 represents the brightest components of the Gaussian fitting, and as we discussed in Sect. 4.2, in some locations of the cloud  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) gas reveals two velocity components. The right panel of Fig. 6 shows the second component, the one with lower intensity. Depending on the location on the map, this less bright component has red or blue velocities compared to the main component. The right panel of Fig. 6 shows that by moving from north to south the faint component is going to the red side of the brightest components. The red velocities appear mostly on the south of the filament and the west side of the protostar position. This is similar to our discussion in Sect. 4.2, where there are three components along the line of sight: the bright one associated with the core and two fainter ones, one in the north and one in the south of the filament.",

Each data point illustrates the location and centroid velocity of an independent Gaussian component. The color of each data point relates to each spectral component (discussed in Sect. 4.2). Orange refers to  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) emitting gas, and the others refer to  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) emitting gas. The velocity structure of the  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) emission is quite complex. Four velocity components are displayed in total. Overall, for  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) we used only two- component fitting, but here we display it in different categories. The blue data correspond to the brightest components of the  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) gas, and the red and cyan points instead are related to the secondary fainter component, when it is located at lower and higher velocities, respectively, with respect to the brightest one.",

We speculate that this is related to the fact that one is an ion and the other is a neutral species, and they behave differently concerning the magnetic fields, or it could be because of the difference between their gas densities. It is important to note that if ions and neutrals behave differently at the same density, this indicates a violation of the flux- freezing assumption. We discuss this point in more detail in Sect. 5.",
