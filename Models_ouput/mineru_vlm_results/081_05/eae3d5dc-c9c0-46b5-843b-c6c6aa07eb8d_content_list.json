We map a given  $\\nu_{0}$  to the value of  $\\max \\{f_1,0\\} - \\max \\{f_2,0\\}$  at the minimum radius for which  $f_{1}$  passes through zero, for the profile that is generated by that specific  $\\nu_{0}$ . The root of this function is the critical velocity, for which  $f_{1}$  and  $f_{2}$  pass through zero simultaneously. Once the critical velocity (or mass loss rate) is found, the full integration is run to a maximum radius of  $10^{10}\\mathrm{cm}$ . The sensitivity of the evolution equations makes it numerically impossible to actually generate the critical solution, as every solution appears as either a breeze solution or an unphysical one that returns to the initial radius, even when  $\\nu_{0}$  is obtained to machine precision. To circumnavigate this issue, we assign  $f_{1}$  and  $f_{2}$  to their absolute values for the full integration.
