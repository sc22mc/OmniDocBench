In addition, we generate samples with the Timewarp model without the MH correction as detailed in Section 3.5. We sample 100 parallel chains for only 10000 steps starting from the same initial state for each test peptide. For each peptide we select only one of these chains that finds all metastable states for evaluations. As before, we compute the ESS/s to compare with MD, showing a median speedup factor of "
