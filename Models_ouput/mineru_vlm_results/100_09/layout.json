In the first iteration, with the simple prompt, LLMs even make a mistake in following the task rules as the new set is wrong in step 3. After analyzing, it presents correct advice on this mistake. However, the analysis at the initial iteration is vague, such as \"try other numbers and operations\". After five iterations, BoT aggregates multiple such analyses, deriving a more potent prompt, making the LLMs select the right numbers 9 and 7. Also, the advice is more concrete and useful. The advice for this right selection is to increase the corresponding evaluation score. Through the continuous accumulation such experiences, BoT progressively refines the prompt, culminating in the direct generation of a correct solution in the 8- th iteration."

When the prompt accumulates issues and advice by the \"adding\" type, both aggregation strategies can lead to high solve rates.

However, BoT (No), which does not perform aggregation but directly uses all reasoning chains from generated trees, suffers the worst performance in all cases, especially when the experience accumulation type is \"adding\". As BoT builds 15 trees each iteration, putting them all together into a prompt may cover core information, not to mention that most such experiences are invalid or harmful."
