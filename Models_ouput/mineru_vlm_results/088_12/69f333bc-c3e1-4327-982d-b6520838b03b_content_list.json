The design and implementation of software architecture for such robots are critical factors that determine their overall performance and success. The perception, world modeling subsystem, planning and control, and gripping and manipulation subsystems were identified as critical components of the software architecture for agricultural robots highlighting the need for robustness, adaptability, and real- time capabilities. This article begins by examining the unique characteristics of the agricultural environment, highlighting its complexity and the need for specialized robotic systems. It identifies different types of agricultural robots, ranging from harvesting robots to food processing and packaging robots. Several challenges in developing agricultural robot software architecture are identified, such as dealing with unpredictable environmental conditions, ensuring efficient data processing, and integrating multiple sensors and actuators. The application of software architecture patterns specifically tailored for agricultural robots is explored, aiming to address these challenges effectively.",

Various software architecture patterns and principles are employed to enhance functionality, performance, and safety in these applications. Limitations of current agricultural robotic architectures are discussed, acknowledging areas where improvements can be made. This article concludes by outlining potential future directions for agricultural robot software architecture, including the integration of advanced AI and ML techniques, enhanced autonomy, improved human- robot interaction including ethical perspective. The ethical architecture for robots is a source of concern, since robots are expected to collaborate with humans. The software architecture must adapt to these technologies to meet the changing demands of the agriculture industry. Although bringing ethical intelligence into robot is still a concept, and much work is needed to integrate ethics into architectural patterns that would work in real life.",
