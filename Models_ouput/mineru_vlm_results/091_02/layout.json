Noncontact capacitive measurements are influenced by variables, such as plate size, distance, sample characteristics, and ambient temperature. The latter, in particular, alters the permittivity of materials between plates, greatly influencing the measured capacitance. Notably, impedance and capacitance in capacitors have an inverse relationship: at higher frequencies, capacitive impedance decreases, leading to increased current flow. It is essential to comprehend this connection to properly interpret the impedance measurements produced by noncontact capacitive methods [13]. In particular, several noncontact methods have been employed for fruit quality evaluation. For instance, the ripening of bananas has been assessed using a noncontact approach with parallel plates to measure the fruit's dielectric properties [14]. Another study used a noncontact approach to test the quality characteristics of bananas based on their dielectric properties, proving the method's effectiveness for determining ripeness and quality changes [15]. The firmness of apples was evaluated noncontact by utilizing a parallel plate capacitor [16]. In addition, the device is used to acquire conductivity spectra from different biological test specimens [17]."

The hole in the stage is precisely sized to match the width of the plates, ensuring that only the segment of the fruit directly interacts with the electric field. The selection of UPVC material was based on its observed lack of effect on the electric field during experiments. The upper plate is fixed at the same height as the UPVC stage to maintain consistency in the air gap on both sides of the sample, satisfying Gaussian law. Also, the setup was enclosed in a plastic box to reduce the influence of the surrounding environment on the measurements. The sample's shape is one of the many elements that determine capacitance. Because of the plates' small dimensions compared to the sample's shape- dependent variations in readings are minimized. This is because the electric field lines between the plates are more uniform when the plates are smaller than the sample, preventing the sample's shape from seriously distorting the electric field [18]."
