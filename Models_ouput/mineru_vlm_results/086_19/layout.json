Although some studies have attempted to conduct transfer- learning- based studies at different scales, sufficient studies should be conducted to comprehend the scalability issue of close- range, greenhouse, commercial fields, and remote imaging. The camera calibration is also a vital parameter for mapping the spectral information [15], [335]. Therefore, with advanced sensor technologies, platforms, and algorithms for plant disease detection and diagnosis, it is anticipated that hyperspectral imaging could be an essential tool to analyze plant disease, phenotype, and genotypes. This will improve the applications for high- throughput studies."

Machine- learningand deep- learning- based algorithms are used to preprocess the data for disease detection and analysis. Employing parallel processing, batch processing, and hardware acceleration could solve these computational challenges and provide a real- time analysis as a viable solution. Currently, the price of hyperspectral cameras is very high, which limits the application for small- scale farmers. Hyperspectral data analysis can also be improved if optical sensors and 3- D structure measurement techniques can be combined [15]. This will help to obtain 3- D information on the plant organs and pathogens."
