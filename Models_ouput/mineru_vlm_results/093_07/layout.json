Recent studies have proposed edge- based systems, such as [11] for precision agriculture, most of which suggested power- hungry hardware, such as Raspberry Pi for computation. This research utilized a microcontroller (MCU)- based system to minimize power consumption, which is a crucial factor for edge- based systems, particularly in agricultural settings where devices must operate on batteries due to the absence of power lines in orchards. The image processing solution is here compared to other commonly used approaches, this time using real image data captured in the field throughout the deployment of the IoT device in orchards for several months in 2023. In addition, the impact of considering past data on the system's accuracy is examined."

The system is an ultra low- cost and low- power device able to detect and count insects on the device itself in the orchard without relying on expensive and power- hungry equipment. Fig. 4 depicts the second version of the proposed device. As described in [44] in detail, the camera unit is an OpenMV board based on an MCU with an embedded camera capable of running lightweight image processing and deep learning methods. In addition, this device supports two- sided traps and a servo motor is used to rotate the trap, so the camera can capture images of the trap on both sides. The purpose of the mechanism is to increase the probability of capturing insects (as the captured area is doubled) and, at the same time, make it more approachable to insects since the sticky area is not shadowed by the camera. The image processing pipeline is shown in Fig. 4. This is a modified version of the image processing pipeline proposed in [44]."
