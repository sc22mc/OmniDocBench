Depending on the essential requirements of a robotic device for agricultural usage, robot software architecture is created differently. Since no single software architecture exists for all applications, extensive knowledge of the various software architectures for robots is needed when creating your own robotic architecture or selecting one from a number of existing architectures. As a result, this article provides a comprehensive history of software architecture and its application in the agricultural domain along with a chronology of how software design has evolved over time. We provide several case studies to understand the importance of application of software architecture in agriculture and food industry and how to choose the best architecture for agricultural tasks. Finally, this article discusses the open obstacles and difficulties that must be addressed in order to ensure more advancements in the development of robot architecture for agricultural applications."

Applications of robotics are no longer limited to industry; they are increasingly spreading into new areas, such as home care, military operations, and rescue operations ([1]), driverless cars on roads, drones for inspection operations, underwater robots, robots for harvesting vegetables or fruits to space exploration. The agricultural sector, for example, has a huge demand for robots, which is expected to rise from USD 4.6 billion in 2020 to USD 20.3 billion by 2025 ([2]). The agricultural robots market is also growing due to a decline in the number of young farmers entering the agricultural sector and an increase in labor minimum wages [3]. Farmers are eagerly seeking a solution to this issue, with autonomous robots being one of the possibilities."

It is crystal clear that to design a robot architecture that involves complex functionality is required a great effort to work the whole system smoothly. However, due to the nonavailability of uniform standards in robotics, there is no commonly accepted robot architecture, especially for AI applications ([4]). This has led to researchers being forced to develop their own robotic software architectures. For that purpose, there exists a large variety of robotic architecture. There are still scarce contributions regarding the global state of the art of different robot architectures suitable for agricultural applications. As the agricultural industry increasingly adopts automation and robotics to address its unique challenges, selecting the right software architectural pattern becomes a crucial decision that can significantly impact the success of projects."

By critically analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each pattern, we aim to guide researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions when selecting the most suitable architectural pattern for their agricultural robotics applications. Through real- world case studies and scenario- based discussions, we highlighted the architectural patterns that align with the unique requirements and challenges encountered in tasks, such as harvesting, food processing, and packaging. We summarize the contribution of this article as follows."
