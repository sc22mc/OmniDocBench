Neurocognitive and psychosomatic phenomena demonstrated during such exercises were instrumentally explored with EEG and other sensors. Neurocognitive modeling in the form of meditative visualization produced persistent temperature effects in the body long after the exercise finished; this raises the question about their psychosomatic or biophysical origin. The work explores this question by comparing experiments with focusing attention inside and outside the body. EEG, temperature, heart and breathing sensors monitor internal body conditions, high resolution differential calorimetric sensors are used to detect thermal effects outside the body. Experiments with 159 attempts (2427 operator- sensor sessions) were carried over five months, control measurements run in the same conditions in parallel to experimental series. Increase of body temperature up to moderate fever zone "

To explain these results, the biophysical hypothesis consists in the spin conversion of water isomers [18]. The spin configuration affects chemical reactivity [19], [20], behavior in electric field [21], magnetic moment [22], evaporation [23], surface tension [24] and other properties, in particular, the heat capacity of water isomers [25]. As a hypothesis, it is assumed that such a spin conversion induced through ASC, as recently proposed in neuroscience [26], [27] e.g. via non- classical brain functions [28], can cause the observed thermal effects."
