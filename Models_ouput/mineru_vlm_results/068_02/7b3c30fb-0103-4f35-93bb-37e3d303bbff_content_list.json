The SWA (i) is appropriate for high- power applications, (ii) enables the fabrication of the phased array with a low number of elements, and (iii) provides the required focused area in both longitudinal and lateral directions. Due to the distribution of the slots in the longitudinal direction, the radiation pattern in H- plane is already focused and in the E- plane it is not. Also, by controlling the number of slots, the size of the focal point in this direction can be adjusted. Needless to say, no more antennas are required in this direction, which can reduce the cost and complexity of the phased array antenna and overall system. By increasing the number of antennas, the focus E- plane can be achieved.",
