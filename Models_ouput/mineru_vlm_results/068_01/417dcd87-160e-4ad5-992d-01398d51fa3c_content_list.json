        "text": "Abstract- Near- field focus (NFF) antennas have been recently used in several applications for different purposes. In this work, the time- reversal (TR) concept is used to shape the phase distribution of the phased array elements for the NFF of the electromagnetic field strength. It is shown that the TR concept is equivalent to the known ray optic method for the NFF. A slotted waveguide phased array antenna operating at  $5.8\\mathrm{GHz}$  is designed to provide the maximum electric field strength at the near- field region of the phased array. It is shown that the application of the full- wave simulation allows for an antenna design that provide high strength of the electromagnetic field and sufficient steerability even at near- field conditions close to the phased array antenna.",

Weed control by microwaves is an environmentally friendly method for replacing chemical or pesticide methods, which are no longer acceptable from an ecological point- of- view. One novel idea is to utilize a phased array antenna to concentrate the electromagnetic (EM) power at the area of the weed. In this regard, it's desired i) to achieve a high power density at the desired area and ii) to allow the focus of the microwave beam to be quickly and specifically targeted on the previously identified weed's location.",
