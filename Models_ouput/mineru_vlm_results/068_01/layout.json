The employed concept can be extended when an air- soil interface is located near a phased array antenna while the ray optic concept cannot. in Section II the concept of the TR is addressed. Section III discusses the antenna design and configuration. Finally, the simulation results and discussion is provided in Section IV and Section [V] respectively."
