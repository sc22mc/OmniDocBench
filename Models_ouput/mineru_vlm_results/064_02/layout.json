Furthermore, the scoring mechanism balances vision and language knowledge, which means that when the quality of explicit OWK is poor, our scoring mechanism can focus more on original image features, greatly improving robustness."

They are commonly trained on a massive amount of unlabeled data at scale (typically via self- supervised learning (Radford et al., 2021)), making them adaptable to various downstream applications. Among these are popular models include GPT- 3 (Brown et al., 2020) and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) as large language model, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) as vision- language model, Dall- E (Ramesh et al., 2021) and Stable Diffusion (Rombach et al., 2022) for text- to- image generation, GaTo (Reed et al.) as a generalist model, and ChatGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) as human- like conversation agent, etc. This paper uses CLIP pre- trained with 400 million image- text pairs as baseline architecture. It learns excellent open- world knowledge and multi- modal representation by learning with such a large- scale corpus, making it ideal as the basic solution. Based on it, we made QR- CLIP to fit the location and time reasoning task."
