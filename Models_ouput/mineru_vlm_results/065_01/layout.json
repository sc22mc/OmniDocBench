Class O objects are known to represent the youngest stage of protostellar evolution (Andre et al. 1993 Andre et al. 2000). Most of their mass is contained in a dense envelope that accretes to the central protostar during the main accretion phase (Maury et al. 2011 Evans et al. 2009). Protostars are deeply embedded in their parent cores, which may cause interactions between protostellar outflows and surrounding gas leading to complex morphologies. Detailing these structures will allow us to learn about the dynamics of protostellar evolution at an early stage. In light of these circumstances, it becomes essential to investigate in detail the earliest stages of star formation for specific sources."

However, in the star formation process, especially during the early stages, magnetic fields (B) are expected to play a crucial role, providing a source of non- thermal pressure against the gravitational pull (McKee & Ostriker 2007). In light of the fact that interstellar gases are often mildly ionized (Caselli et al. 1998), the matter is likely to be coupled with the magnetic field lines at envelope scales. Due to gravity, magnetic lines bend inward, thus producing an hourglass shape, and in low- mass starforming regions this effect is not detected frequently (detected in 30 percent of young stellar objects in polarization; Hull & Zhang 2019; Pattle et al. 2022)."

Lupus I is the least evolved component of the Lupus complex (Rygl et al. 2013), and optical polarization studies have demonstrated that Lupus I is threaded by a very ordered magnetic field that is perpendicular to its filamentary extension (Franco & Alves 2015). Therefore, it is an ideal place to study the kinematics of the early stages of low- mass star formation and the connection between the source kinematics and the strong large- scale magnetic field. By observing its CO emission line with the single- dish and interferometric observation, a molecular outflow was detected from this source (Tachihara et al. 1996; Bjorkeli et al. 2016; van Kempen et al. 2009).
