To encourage such human- like reasoning, in this work, we teach machines to predict where and when it was taken rather than performing basic tasks like traditional segmentation or classification. Inspired by Horn's QR theory (Horn, 1984), we designed a novel QR- CLIP model consisting of two components: 1) the Quantity module first retrospects more open- world knowledge as the candidate language inputs; 2) the Relevance module carefully estimates vision and language cues and infers the location and time. Experiments show our QR- CLIP's effectiveness, and it outperforms the previous SOTA on each task by an average of about "

Some companies like OpenAI and DeepMind have developed a series of models, including GPT- 3 (Brown et al., 2020), CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), and ChatGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), etc. Most of those foundation models learn on their own from large amounts of online data made by people in a self- supervised fashion. This gives the models a certain amount of \"open- world knowledge\" (OWK). This motivates us to use CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) as our basic architecture to solve the proposed task since it shows effective performance in a number of multimodal tasks."

However, this knowledge is more encapsulated within the model. It can only be used implicitly through in- context learning (Min et al., 2022), preventing OWK from playing a larger role in our tasks. To solve this problem, we design a model named QR- CLIP with the capability to infer the location- and- time- related meta- information about the image. It is inspired by Horn's QR theory (Horn, 1984): Q- principle (quantity) requires maximization of the information content, which means \"ask speaker to present as much information as possible\". In contrast, the R- principle (relevance) requires minimization of form, which means \"should focus more on the relevant content\"."
