Here, the wave heating due to weak shocks begins before the start of seed formation. Therefore, the substantial increase in the entropy inhibits seed formation, and leaves a large neutron- to- seed ratio when alpha capture ends. This is mainly driven by the impact of  $\\omega$  on the shock heating activation radius, and less so by the variation in  $l_{d}$  with  $\\omega$  . This is illustrated by the model shown in figure 9 that assumes  $\\omega = 2\\times 10^{3}$  rad  $\\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$  but an instantaneous activation of shock heating.

The results are noticeably different than those shown in figure 6, which shows models with the same parameters but without instantaneous shock heating. For instantaneous activation, the average mass of the abundance distribution increases monotonically with  $L_{w} / L_{\\nu}$  and for even moderate wave luminosities is able to produce a full r- process. This illustrates that uncertainty in the shock formation radius translates into significant uncertainty in the predicted nucleosynthesis for gravito- acoustic NDWs.",

In the absence of wave effects, the neutrino spectrum used here should preclude any r- processing whatsoever. The wind would undergo an alpha- rich freezeout, leaving only free protons to capture onto seed nuclei. However, with wave effects included, we find similar r- processing regimes to those obtained with neutrino energies tuned to  $Y_{e} = 0.48$  . In the wave stress regime, with  $5\\times 10^{- 4}\\lesssim L_w / L_\\nu \\lesssim 5\\times 10^{- 3}$  , the change in  $Y_{e}$  is not large enough to make the wind neutron rich, but the faster outflow caused by the wave stress prevents an  $\\alpha$  - rich freezeout from occurring. R- process elements are then synthesized from the free neutrons in the wind, despite the wind being overall proton- rich. This gives rise to the suppressed, actinide- free r- process patterns in figure 11. In between the r- processing regimes, we again find a region where the combined entropy and dynamical timescale in the wind favor strong seed formation and thus no r- processing, regardless of  $Y_{e}$  or the presence of an  $\\alpha$  - rich freezeout. At high  $L_{w}$  , the wind becomes neutron- rich again, and early wave heating suppresses seed formation and drives the same strong r- processing as in figure 7.",

Here, we have used  $Y_{e,\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.48$ $\\omega = 2\\times 10^{3}$  rad  $\\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$  and assumed the shock formation radius is given by equation 13. We find the abundance of nuclei with  $A\\geq 150$  to be an effective proxy for the strength of the r- process in the wind (see e.g. figure 7). Two r- processing regimes appear. For the highest neutrino and wave luminosities, shock heating begins early enough in the wind to drive a strong r- process. This shock heating regime is fairly insensitive to PNS mass but very dependent on wave frequency, which sets how early shock heating can begin in the wind. The second r- processing regime, driven by acceleration due to the wave stress, is strongly dependent on mass but insensitive to wave frequency. We see this regime emerge at a PNS mass of around  $1.8M_{\\odot}$  and grow to dominate the parameter space for the most massive neutron stars. The non- monotonic dependence of the average mass number of the final abundances is also visible here. At higher masses, the wave stress contribution is able to drive strong r- processes even for very low neutrino and wave luminosities, where shock heating begins too late to strongly affect the nucleosynthesis. We have also run similar calculations with  $Y_{e,\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.45$  . These show qualitatively similar behavior to the results shown in figure 12, except that the onset of wave stressdriven r- process nucleosynthesis is shifted to lower PNS mass.",

This is perhaps to be expected, as the change in  $Y_{e}$  is driven primarily by the wave stress reducing the amount of neutrino heating needed to unbind the wind material. We also observe generally higher yields of r- process material when  $Y_{e}$  evolution is included, due to the higher number of free neutrons available.",

When these waves propagate through the NDW, they impose additional stresses on the wind and also may shock and provide an extra source of heating. Using steady- state, spherically symmetric models for the wind that include the impact of an acoustic wave energy flux, we surveyed the parameter space of the gravito- acoustic wave luminosity and frequency that is expected to be produced by PNS convection. The presence of shock heating in the wind precludes reliance upon the common predictive metric  $s^3 /\\tau_d$  , as entropy is no longer nearly constant during seed formation. Therefore, using the results of our hydrodynamic models, we then performed calculations of nucleosynthesis for the marginally neutron- rich compositions that may be encountered in some NDWs.",
