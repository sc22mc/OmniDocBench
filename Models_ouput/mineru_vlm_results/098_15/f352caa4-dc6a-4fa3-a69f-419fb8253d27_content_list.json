While less capable than humans in many real- world scenarios, GPT- 4 exhibits human- level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top  $10\\%$  of test takers. GPT- 4 is a Transformer- based model pre- trained to predict the next token in a document. The post- training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT- 4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT- 4.",
