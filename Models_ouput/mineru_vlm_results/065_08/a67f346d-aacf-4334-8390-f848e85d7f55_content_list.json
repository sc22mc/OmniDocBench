        "text": "Figure 7 shows that the main velocity component of the  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) data and the  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) line present a systematic velocity shift. The  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) data always appear at a higher velocity than the  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) spectra. In order to investigate this point further, we show in Fig. 8 the velocity difference  $V_{\\mathrm{ISF}}(\\mathrm{C^{18}O}) - V_{\\mathrm{ISF}}(\\mathrm{DCO^{+}})$  with the  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  column density overlaid on top. In addition, we did not find any correlation between the velocity shift and the  $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$  column density map. In this figure the shift between  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (2- 1) and  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) is clearly visible. We report a mean velocity shift of  $0.13\\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$  across the whole source. The largest velocity shift values are found on the west side of the protostellar core, where the infalling material from the envelope reaches the core, under the assumption that the small velocity gradient seen along the filament represents an accretion flow. On the southeast and northwest sides of the core there is a very low- velocity shift, equal to  $\\sim 0.06\\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$  and these values are increasing toward the protostar position up to  $0.10\\mathrm{km}\\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$ . To calculate these low- velocity shifts we use the pixels indicated with a black plus sign in Fig. 8",

        "text": "Star- forming regions can be more completely understood by analyzing the distribution of different molecular species in the velocity. We compare the velocity shift between these two tracers in the cloud. The velocity shift between a neutral and an ionized species was observed in the past. For instance, Henshaw et al. (2013) studied the large- scale velocity field throughout the cloud in G035.39- 00.33, and found a velocity shift between the two tracers of  $\\mathrm{N}_2\\mathrm{H}^+ (1 - 0)$  and  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}$  (1- 0), in agreement with a model of collision between filaments that is still ongoing. It follows that the velocity structure of the core does not have intrinsic properties but is a product of large- scale motions on filamentary scales. They proposed that the velocity difference in the cloud occurs because of filament merging, implying that higher velocity filaments are interacting with a lower velocity, less massive filament, increasing the density of an intermediate velocity filament (Barnes et al. 2018).",

According to Zhang et al. 2017 velocity shifts between high- density and low- density tracers within a cloud are indicative of gas expanding and contracting. It is based on the assumption that the higher critical density molecules trace the dense gas closer to the inner of a core, while lower critical density molecules trace the more extended gas in the outer envelope.",

According to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse models, magnetic braking should be effective in this cloud, which is in agreement with the absence of a resolved Keplerian disk. Magnetic braking is an effective way to remove angular momentum from infalling and rotating material, suppressing envelope fragmentation and the formation of large disks.",
