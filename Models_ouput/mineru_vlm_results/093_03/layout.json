Instead, we focus on the computer vision algorithms used to detect BMSB in images collected autonomously by the drone. From this perspective, it is evident that the majority of achievements related to BMSB detection have been generated within the HALy.ID project. Furthermore, unlike others, we are currently exploring solutions that can accurately determine the BMSB's position directly from aerial or in- field images."

Typically, the main applications for detecting nonvisible damage, internal to the fruit pulp, using SWIR- HSI, refer to the presence of bruising [22], [23], [24]. Efficient techniques for rapid and effective quality assessment of fruits and vegetables are essential to meet the growing consumer demand for better, more consistent, and safer food products. Lu et al. [25] focused on three innovative HSI- based techniques or sensing platforms—spectral scattering, integrated reflectance and transmittance, and spatially resolved spectroscopy—that have been developed in the laboratory for property and quality evaluation of fruits, vegetables, and other food products. Similarly, Alamar et al. [26] focused on the detection of mechanical damages, including bruising. Interestingly, Zamljen et al. [27] examined the metabolic response of apples to BMSB punctures. Compared to healthy fruits, the sugar and phenolic compounds contents differ, suggesting that NIR- HSI imaging could be useful in detecting damages caused by the BMSB. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no previous works concerning BMSB puncture detection and its annotation, which followed a practical on- field protocol and involved numerous samples collected over several years."

The next step is image preprocessing, which involves removing noise and distortion, resizing images, adjusting brightness and contrast, and data augmentation. From the preprocessed dataset, a representative subset of images needs to be selected for training CNNs to identify and classify insects in the images and adjust internal weights to improve accuracy. Then, the CNN must be validated and tested on separate image subsets to evaluate its performance."

Like YOLOv5, SSD performs object detection, namely, object localization and classification, in a single forward pass. Key to its success is the use of a series of convolutional layers that produce feature maps at multiple scales, enabling the SSD to detect objects of various sizes within the image. The implementation of SSD in our application was implemented using the PyTorch library. For the SSD backbone we leverage VGG16 [30]. Although SSD demonstrates a rapid detection"
