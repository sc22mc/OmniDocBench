To address such challenges, saliency map extraction has been proposed as a powerful step in point cloud processing to reduce noise and data dimensionality, leading to more robust solutions and computational efficiency [32] [33]. Yet, the use of local saliency in pothole detection has not been sufficiently examined. Saliency maps were constructed from point clouds obtained from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) in [34] for road crack detection. MLS point clouds contain spatial information (i.e., Euclidean coordinates) and intensity information, and thus the extracted features could leverage both height and intensity information. Feature saliency was estimated by calculating the distances from the normal of each point to the principal normal of the input point clouds. In a similar setting, Wang et al. [35] extracted saliency maps in MLS point clouds by projecting the distance of each point's normal vector to the point cloud's dominant normal vector into a hyperbolic tangent function space."

Objects, captured by the single-agent's sensor devices, may be heavily occluded or far away from the sensors' view, resulting in sparse observations. Nevertheless, failing to detect and predict the accurate position or moving intention of these occluded or \"hard-to-see\" objects might have harmful consequences in safety-critical situations, and especially if the reaction time is very narrow [36]. The development of multi-agent solutions can lead to collaborative perception and, through information sharing, may improve the driving performance and experiences, providing endless possibilities for safe driving."

Both fusion approaches can extend the perception of the sensing system, however, only the early fusion approach can actually exploit complementary information. A major challenge that arises regarding cooperative perception is how to effectively merge sensors' data received from different vehicles to obtain a precise and comprehensive perception outcome. Additionally, despite the attention that cooperative driving has attracted recently, the absence of a suitable open dataset for benchmarking algorithms has made it difficult to develop and assess cooperative perception technologies."

They also plan to extend the dataset with more tasks as well as sensor suites and investigate more multimodal sensor fusion methods in the V2V and V2I (vehicle- to- infrastructure) settings. Arnold et al. [37] proposed a system that produces a perception of complex road segments (e.g., complex T- junctions and roundabouts) using a network of roadside infrastructure sensors with fixed positions. Chen et al. [39] studied the raw- data level cooperative perception for enhancing the detection ability of self- driving systems. They fuse the sensor data collected from different positions and angles of connected vehicles, relying on LiDAR 3D point clouds. Liu et al. [40] addressed the collaborative perception problem, where one agent is required to perform a perception task and can communicate and share information with other agents on the same task."

[42] proposed a cooperative fusion method to combine spatial feature maps for achieving a higher 3D object detection performance. Yuan et al. [43] proposed a 3D keypoints feature fusion scheme for cooperative driving detection to remedy the problem of low bounding box localization accuracy. Fang et al. [44] presented an iterated split covariance intersection filter- based cooperative localization strategy with a decentralized framework. In addition, they adopted a point cloud registration method to obtain the relative pose estimation using mutually shared information from neighbour vehicles. Kim and Liu [45] presented the concept of cooperative autonomous driving using mirror neuron- inspired intention awareness and cooperative perception, providing information on the upcoming traffic situations ahead, even beyond line- of- sight and field- of- view."
