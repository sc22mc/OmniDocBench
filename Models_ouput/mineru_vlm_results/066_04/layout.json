Wavelet- based video coding provides full scalability without additional overhead. The temporal resolution can be controlled by the recursive application of the WT in temporal direction to the LP subband of the previous stage. This leads to lower bit rates, but if the content of the underlying video sequence comprises strong motion, the visual quality of the BL is degraded significantly. We proposed a method which locally adapts the temporal scaling by evaluating a Lagrangian cost functional in every transformation step and prevents further decomposition, if the costs of the current level are higher than the costs of the previous level. This way, we can increase the visual quality of the BL by "
