AVIRIS obtained 224 bands of spectral signal in the visible- to- SWIR range. The AVIRIS image data were used to analyze the chlorophyll, water content, yield [60], [61], [62], [63], mapping crop areas [64], [65], pest infections [66], and soil properties [67]. Besides AVIRIS, AISA Eagle, the hyperspectral mapper (HyMap), and compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) sensors are used for airplane- based hyperspectral imaging. AISA Eagle is well known to estimate the nitrogen content [68] and biomass of the plants [69]. CASI and HyMap images are used to calculate chlorophyll content [70], crop yield [71], detecting plant stress [72], and biochemical properties [73]. The disadvantage of airplane- based hyperspectral imaging is that the scheduling and flight operation are expensive. The airplanes should fly at "

Direct methods are the methods where the pathogens such as bacteria, fungal, or viral diseases are directly identified [101] by using serological methods (such as enzyme- linked, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence methods) and molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction method, DNA array detection, and fluorescence in situ method) [100]. These methods can provide accurate information about the pathogens causing the diseases [101]. On the contrary, the indirect method detects plant diseases through many other indirect parameters such as a change in transpiration rate, change in temperature, morphological change, or organic components released by the diseased plants [101]. Indirect methods include biomarker- based detection techniques, such as gaseous metabolite profiling, plant metabolite profiling, and plant- property- based disease detection techniques, including both imaging and spectroscopic techniques [100]. Among the imaging techniques, hyperspectral imaging is an emerging technique, as it can capture the spectral profile of plants, which presents the changes in plants' morphological and physiological characteristics. Consequently, hyperspectral imaging is categorized under indirect methods as it identifies the potential symptoms in plants rather than directly identifying the pathogens causing the disease. Hence, this article primarily addresses hyperspectral imaging techniques for plant disease detection, and other methods of plant disease detection are not reviewed."
