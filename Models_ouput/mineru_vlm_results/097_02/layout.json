Our contribution is not limited to shortening the measurement time for a light field, but it enables us to go beyond the limitation of the frame- rate of image sensors; Our method can better utilize the time resource during a single exposure, and obtain more information per unit time (i.e., being time- efficient) than the baseline coded- aperture imaging method. Our method is also distinctive in the sense that events are induced actively by the camera's optics rather than the moving objects or ego- motion of the camera."

Lens- array- based cameras [1, 2, 31, 32] gained popularity because a light field can be captured in a single shot. However, this type of camera has an intrinsic trade- off between the number of views and the spatial resolution of each view. Mask- based coded- imaging methods [10, 14, 22, 26, 29, 30, 45, 47] have been developed to increase the efficiency of light- field acquisition. With coded- aperture imaging, two to four images, taken from a stationary camera with different aperture- coding patterns, are sufficient to computationally reconstruct a light field with "

Our method also applies several aperture- coding patterns during a single exposure, but we combine them with an off- the- shelf event camera to achieve time- efficient and accurate light- field acquisition."

Compared with ordinary frame- based cameras, event cameras can capture more fine- grained temporal information in a higher dynamic range, which opens up many applications such as optical- flow estimation, deblurring, video interpolation, and camera pose estimation. Event cameras have also been used extensively for 3- D reconstruction [17, 24, 35, 37, 56, 57]. In these studies, however, the events were usually caused either by the moving objects or ego- motion of the camera. Our method can be regarded as a new application of an event camera; the events are induced actively by the camera's optics in the framework of computational imaging."

Since this is geometrically an ill- posed problem, SVVS methods rely on implicit prior knowledge learned from the training dataset rather than physical cues. These methods are not necessarily designed to be physically accurate but to hallucinate a visually- plausible 3- D scene. Our method takes an orthogonal approach to SVVS; we use not only a single image but also a coded aperture and events to obtain solid physical cues from the target 3D scene."
