            "FIG. 3. Crystal- and magnetic-structure models and their DFT energies. (a) Schematics of the structure models with various Mn/Bi intermixing scenarios.  $\\mathrm{S_0}$  is the defect-free case while the panels from  $\\mathrm{S_1}$  to  $\\mathrm{S_{10}}$  visualize the structural differences to  $\\mathrm{S_0}$ . Models  $\\mathrm{S_1}$  to  $\\mathrm{S_4}$ : antisite Mn (green) is in the 6c site of the QLs; models  $\\mathrm{S_5}$  to  $\\mathrm{S_8}$ : antisite Mn is in the 6c site of the SLs; models  $\\mathrm{S_9}$  to  $\\mathrm{S_{15}}$ : antisite Mn is in the 6c positions of both QLs and SLs. (b) Schematics of the constructed magnetic arrangements. Each model has a distinct order between the Mn magnetic moments in the  $3a$  and 6c positions which are conditioned by the respective structure model in (a). Ferromagnetic order with an out-of-plane orientation of the moments is assumed within each atomic layer. (c) Total energy difference between an antiferromagnetic ordering model (1, 2 or 3) of each structure model ( $\\mathrm{S_0}$  to  $\\mathrm{S_{15}}$ ) and the respective fully ferromagnetic configuration, as obtained from the scalar-relativistic DFT calculations. The dashed line follows the ground state energy, zero corresponding to the FM phase."

They all have in common that the Mn moments order FM within any given atomic layer, but vary in the magnetic couplings between the adjacent atomic layers along the stack. In the AFM  $\\mathbb{1}$  and AFM  $\\mathcal{Z}$  models, the Mn spins in the two consequent  $3a$  positions are oppositely coupled. The coupling between the  $3a$  site and all intermixed Mn neighbours in the 6c site(s) is either AFM (AFM  $\\mathbb{1}$  ) or FM (AFM  $\\mathcal{Z}$  ), respectively. The AFM  $\\mathcal{Z}$  model realises parallel spin arrangement in the  $3a$  sites, while they couple AFM with the Mn defects in all 6c positions.",

All but one models of the first two categories, where the intermixed Mn cations occupy either the SLs or the QLs, show an AFM configuration as the lower energy state. This preference reverts markedly if the antisite Mn distributes over the 6c positions of both the QLs and the SLs: five out of the seven constructed structure configurations of this category prefer the FM phase. A closer look reveals that the preference for the FM state is particularly prominent in those structure models ( $\\mathrm{S_{12}}$  to  $\\mathrm{S_{15}}$ ), in which the Mn cations occupy the nearby 6c positions not separated by the  $3a$  positions - namely, when continuous magnetic exchange pathways exist between the antisite Mn ions.",
