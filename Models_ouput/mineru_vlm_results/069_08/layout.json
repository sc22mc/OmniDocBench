The spin conversion changes the equilibrium 3:1 rate of spin isomers and thus changes the heat capacity. This in turn results in a symmetry breaking dynamics of temperature in differential calorimeters. The spin conversion can be triggered by different weak interactions (with minimal energy about "

Spin effects were found in biochemical reactions and cognitive processes of the brain involving phosphorus and xenon [27], [48], in various processes of animate and inanimate nature [49], [50]. Natural materials (e.g., molecules) are capable of performing certain calculations at the molecular or spin levels, which is studied in natural computing [51]- [53]. Due to long- range spin- spin interactions [39], [40], internal and external thermal phenomena can be considered as manifestations of one common process.
