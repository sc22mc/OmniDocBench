This means that the interest rate- and FX- deltas are aggregated over all positions, and the aggregated deltas are then neutralized by respective derivatives that are monitored in a separate bucket. On the one hand, this management practice is efficient because there is no need to enter hedging derivative contracts for each and every position. On the other hand, it is difficult to decompose the interest rate- and FX- hedges in the separate bucket in order to obtain attributions to the single positions. The latter difficulty is precisely what can be overcome with the presented methodology, which helps to isolate the actual contribution of the single positions to the total fund's PnL, just like in the negative basis example of the previous paragraph."
