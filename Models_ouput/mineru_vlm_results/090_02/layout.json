Such methods demonstrate the potential for cost- effective and continuous proximal plant monitoring, offering valuable insights into plant health conditions. Among these, bioimpedance is attracting an increasing interest in the field, especially for what concerns its application in measuring the electrical impedance of biological tissues when exposed to an alternating current (ac) stimulus, which can be in the form of either voltage or current [13]. The impedance of biological tissues is influenced by a variety of factors, such as their health status, structural attributes, and chemical composition. When an ac stimulus is applied, at lower frequencies, the current predominantly flows through the fluid surrounding the cells, whereas at higher frequencies, it tends to pass through the cells themselves [14]. The impedance properties of plant tissues are intimately linked to several passive electrical characteristics, including the ion content in the cells, the integrity of the cell membranes, and the viscosity of the tissue [15]. Although bioimpedance has been previously employed in plant monitoring [16], [17], [18], [19], to the best of our knowledge, the use of this technique for the continuous assessment of the effects of iron deficiency on plant health remains largely unexplored. This study focuses on the investigation of the impact of iron deficiency on 8 tomato plants by monitoring the impedance of their stems over a duration of 38 days. The experiment was carried out in a glasshouse, with controlled environmental conditions, reducing the effect of the environmental variability, thus increasing scientific rigor in comparison with alternative literature with a comparable, usually smaller population of plants [17], [18], [20], [21], [22]. The impedance data were collected using a semiportable impedance analyzer in the "

As an initial assessment, the evolution of the bioimpedance magnitude at fixed frequency was analyzed over time showing a deviation between the control and iron- stressed plants. Subsequently, the entire bioimpedance data were fitted to the Cole model equivalent circuit [23]. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) proved the statistical difference between the equivalent circuit parameter extracted for control and stressed plant. Based on this, the equivalent circuit parameters were employed as features to successfully train a data classification model to discriminate between iron- deficient and control plants. The study emphasizes the potential of stem impedance measurements as indicators of plant response to iron deficiency, presenting a novel method for monitoring plant health and enhancing crop management."

The control group, consisting of four plants, remained exposed to a complete Hoagland nutrient solution [24] throughout the entire experiment. In contrast, the four iron- stressed plants underwent three distinct phases over the duration of the experiment, carried out within the optimal tomato growth window and lasting a total of 38 days. The first phase represented the optimal conditions, characterized by optimal nutrient availability, from 29th of July to 4th of August. This initial phase was designed to bring all the plants to comparable health conditions before the application of iron stress. The second phase, from 5th of August to 27th of August, represents the iron deficiency condition, wherein iron was deliberately removed from the nutrient solution. Finally, in the recovery phase, the iron was reintroduced into the nutrient solution until 5th September."

Measurements were continuously acquired for a period of 38 days with 1- h acquisition interval, resulting in a final dataset consisting in a total of 7557 impedance spectra, respectively, divided into 3881 spectra from the control and 3676 spectra from the iron- stressed plants."
