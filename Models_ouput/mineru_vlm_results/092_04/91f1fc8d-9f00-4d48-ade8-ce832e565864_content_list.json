While some tasks can quickly be interrupted, and their progress can be recovered through intermittent computing strategies, other tasks, such as message exchanges and measurements, require uninterrupted execution not to yield erroneous results. Energy- aware scheduling only triggers uninterruptible tasks when the stored energy is sufficient to ensure their continuous execution. This requires uninterruptible task energy profiling and state of charge estimation. When capacitors are used as energy storage for the sensor node, the state of charge can easily be determined through their voltage  $V_{\\mathrm{STOR}}$ . By previously knowing task energy requirements, we evaluate the  $V_{\\mathrm{STOR}}$  threshold that triggers the task and ensure completion.",

This is done by triggering EIS execution when the storage is charged to  $V_{\\mathrm{EIS}}$ , and transmission (TX) when storage grows to  $V_{\\mathrm{TX}}$ .
