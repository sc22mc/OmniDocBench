This raises a fundamental question for anybody who wants to apply RL to the problem of CC: when should the next action be taken? While other similar approaches, like [16, 17], gather statistics during a fixed amount of time to compute the state and take the next action, MARLIN implements a different heuristic algorithm. Every time the transport protocol makes new network statistics available to MARLIN, if at least the last reported SRTT has elapsed since the time the last action was taken, data collected up to that time is refined, the reward "

Utilizing real components allowed us to understand the challenges that the CC domain brings to RL, avoiding the risk of failing a \"sim- to- real\" transposition, which could be caused, by inaccurate emulated/simulated patterns and weak assumptions, at the cost of a slower training time. Relying on real hardware and protocol implementation intrinsically diversifies training experience thanks to the stochasticity of the environment and it prevents the agent from overfitting on artificial patterns that would not be found in the real world."
