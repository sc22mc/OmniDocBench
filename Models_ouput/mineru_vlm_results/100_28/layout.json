Mariah used 1/4 of a skein and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To find the total amount of skein they used, we need to add 1/4 and 1/2. Evaluate Score: 1.0 Step 2: After finding the total amount of skein they used, convert it into yards. We know that 1 skein is equal to 364 yards. So, multiply the total skein used by 364 to find the total yards in 273 of yarn they used."

The task is to find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether. The reasoning chain first calculates the total skein of yarn used by adding the fractions of the skeins used by Mariah and her grandma. It then converts this total skein amount into yards, which is the final answer required. Reasoning step 1: The first step is a logical inference as it correctly identifies that the first step to solving the problem is to add the fractions of the skeins used by Mariah and her grandma. This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it sets the stage for the conversion of skeins to yards in the next step. No errors are found in this step. Advice: No advice is needed as this step is correct to correct reasoning. I recommend this step as it correctly identifies the need to calculate the total skeins used first."
