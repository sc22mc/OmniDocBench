It is clearly evident that external and system- internal factors do not provide any reasons for a change of temperature trend inside the calorimeter (especially for only one channel of the calorimeter). Experimental sessions take 20- 30 minutes, temperature changes extend far beyond the sessions, typically 60- 90 minutes after, until the differential temperature again balances in the calorimeters. To exclude computational artifacts caused by nonlinear regression, Figs. 10(h) and 10(i) demonstrate the same experiment in linear (without a priori knowledge about the session time) and nonlinear regression (with a priori knowledge about the session time): typically nonlinear approximation provides better fitting of background region and more clear separation of different trends, however it should not be used for long post- experimental regions due to accumulation of errors.",

Since experiments involved several calorimeters working in parallel (served also as control devices), mediators attempted to affect several of them during one session. We noticed two atypical behaviors of calorimeters installed in the same measurement room. First, if at the beginning of experiments only one targeted sensor/channel responded, as shown in Fig. 8(a), towards the end of all experiments several fluidic sensors may have responded (however, still with a difference between targeted and not targeted channels). Second, as the experiments progressed, the water used in calorimeters exhibited increasing thermal fluctuations and therefore required",
