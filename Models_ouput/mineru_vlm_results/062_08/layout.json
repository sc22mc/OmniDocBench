In the case of partial or conditional driving automation, our framework could be used to prepare the driver to quickly take the control of the vehicle, if requested. In order to ensure that the driver is able to swiftly take over the control of the vehicle in an efficient way, we developed a notification system that presents relevant information about the condition of the environment. Our notification system is based on non- intrusive visual cues to prevent tunnel visioning, alerting the driver of potential risks and also directing his/her attention to the objects of interest that sparked the take- over request. In that way, in addition to assisting the human operator during manual driving, the system can, in times of automated driving, trigger the attention of "

Assuming the position is known for the AR interface and the LiDAR relative to the world, we construct a transformation matrix to map the points of the point cloud from the LiDAR relative coordinate system to the AR interface's coordinate system. The transformation between two different coordinate systems is typically performed by applying serially a scale, a rotation and then a translation transformation. Since both coordinate systems are orthonormal, the scaling can be omitted. Also, by taking advantage of the rigid body nature of the vehicle where the LiDAR and AR interface is located, we also omit the rotation matrix given that, without loss of generality, we can assume that the two coordinate systems are aligned. According to these assumptions, the LiDAR coordinates are transformed into the AR interface's coordinates by a simple translation."
