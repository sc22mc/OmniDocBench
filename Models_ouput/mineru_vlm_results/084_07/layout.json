Results are then compared to the performance of Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), which in our system uses TCP CUBIC as the transport protocol, on the same file transfer task. Figure 5 shows the optimal behaviour, computed from the a- priori knowledge of the background traffic, along with the batch of results obtained from the trained agents. The average, best, and worst performance of TCP CUBIC are also shown under the same conditions after having repeated the transfer 100 times as well. Figure 3 presents the variation of the CwND size during MARLIN's best run across all the three experiments. The color of each segment represents the RTT of the communication measured during a period of one SRTT immediately following the action that took the CwND size to the value represented by the rightmost end of the segment."

Excluding aborted runs, MARLIN reached the target in 46.1s in average in 5a 50.31s in 5b and 46.9s in 5c. All agents' best performance was faster than TCP CUBIC's best. In 5a 48% of the experiments achieve a performance equal or better than the average accomplished by TCP CUBIC. 31% in 5b and 47% in 5c. The fastest transfer was completed by 5b in 24.84s, 27% faster than the fastest SCP transfer and 45% faster than its average. For comparison, the available bandwidth on the link allows file transfers to be completed in 25s (see Figure 5); faster transfers can still occur if the traffic injected by MARLIN causes other flows to slow down."

Traditional CC algorithms aim at achieving full bottleneck link utilization by applying diverse heuristic strategies that increase the CwND size until a congestion sign emerges, such as a packet loss, e.g., NewReno [28] and CUBIC [29] (the default CC algorithm in modern Linux kernels and recent Windows operating systems), or an increase in latency, e.g., Vegas [30] and, more recently, BBR [31]. These approaches have been shown to work well under specific network conditions, but underperform or experience other types of issues in other scenarios [2, 33, 34]."

Some approaches focus on addressing very specific problem of transport protocols, such as accurately identifying congestion events, but do not aim at replacing CC algorithms. For instance, researchers have successfully built ML- based models that can distinguish between losses caused"
