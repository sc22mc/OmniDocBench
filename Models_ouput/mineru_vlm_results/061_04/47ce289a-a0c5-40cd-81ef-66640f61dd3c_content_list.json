For each energy spectrum, we performed Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling in XSPEC, with the sampling algorithm from the emcee software package (Foreman- Mackey et al. 2013). We fixed the following three parameters: the constant value, the iron abundance  $A_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$  and the ionization parameter  $\\log \\xi$  to the same as the average energy spectrum. We set 20 walkers with the prior parameters from the average energy spectrum fitting result in subsection 2.2. We used a Gaussian prior with a center as the best- fitting value from the parameters of the averaged energy spectrum and a width as  $20\\%$ . We set 5,000 walkers and 5,000 burn- in steps. The median value of the posterior samples is taken as the best- fitting value for each free parameter. The  $68\\%$  interval of reduced chi- square extracted from the median value of posterior chi- squares is 0.93 to 1.1, which indicates that all the 5s energy spectra are well- fitted by the model.",

We can see that the inner disk radius  $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$  , the electron temperature  $kT_{\\mathrm{e}}$  and the optical depth  $\\tau$  show almost identical distribution between peak and trough. The other three parameters are larger in the peak phase than in the trough phase. Especially, the  $68\\%$  intervals of the normalization norm and the reflection fraction  $\\mathcal{R}$  show no overlap, indicating a significant difference between these two parameters between peak and trough phases. According to the results, we obtain that the peak and trough phase short timescale spectral parameters  $T_{in}$ $\\mathcal{R}$  and norm are different at least  $50\\%$ $76\\%$  and  $96\\%$  significance level. So at least the spectral parameter norm significantly changes with the QPO phases .

The normalization determines the photon flux of both Compton and reflection components by the same factor. The reflection fraction  $\\mathcal{R}$  also varies between peak and trough phases. The photon flux of the reflection component is determined by norm  $\\times \\mathcal{R}$  (Niedzwiecki et al. 2019). So the variation of  $\\mathcal{R}$  makes the flux variability of the reflection component different from that of the Compton component. The normalization and reflection fraction are also found to significantly vary with the QPO phase in another BHXRB H1743- 322, in which the normalization is also the parameter that bears the most significant change (Ingram et al. 2017). There is also difference in the inner disk temperature  $T_{\\mathrm{in}}$  between that of the peak and of the trough. Since the disk component was very weak in the observation and the inner disk temperature is tied to the seed photon temperature for Compotonization in the model we applied, we can not distinguish whether the variation in  $T_{\\mathrm{in}}$  was due to intrinsic disk variability or potential variation in the Compton component.",
