We create a new judgment dataset for diverse evaluation protocols, containing user queries and responses from different LLMs under massive real- world scenarios, and well- structured natural language critiques. Experiments demonstrate that AUTO- J significantly outperforms both open- source and closed- source baselines models. Last but not least, we release a wealth of resources to facilitate future research."
