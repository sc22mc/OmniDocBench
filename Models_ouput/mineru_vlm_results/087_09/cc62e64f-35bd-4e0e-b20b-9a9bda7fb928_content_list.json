The authors can only speculate that this was due to a decision to bale the inner swathes as hay (unwrapped drier fodder), with a separate baling implement.

This can be explained by the erosion and dilation operation in Stage II. The bulb turn pixels are isolated from the main field object body when the erosion operation is applied to the sampled coordinate image. The bulb turn area is deemed too small by the algorithm to be classified as a unique field, therefore, the in- field bulb turn coordinate points are labeled as a path.",
