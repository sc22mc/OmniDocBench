Mockets implements a very aggressive CC algorithm whose purpose is to fully utilize the available bandwidth in presence of variable communication latency and elevated packet loss. While it presents several advantages over TCP and other transport protocols in degraded environments [27], Mockets' existing CC fails to share link capacity with other communication flows going through the same links and cannot adapt quickly to changes in the available bandwidth. Therefore, Mockets could benefit significantly from MARLIN, which could make it a viable choice also for traditional network scenarios."

To do so, the sender keeps track of the transmission time of each packet. When an ACK arrives, the sender computes the RTT by calculating the difference between the current time and the transmission time of the last packet received by the receiver before generating the ACK message and then subtracting the ACK processing time from it. To make this calculation possible, the receiver appends the identifier of the last received packet (a strictly increasing unsigned integer) and the processing time (in microseconds) to all ACK messages."
