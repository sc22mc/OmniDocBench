Nuclear fusion reactions, which often occur in high energy density plasmas, are some of the most relevant reactions contributing to nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution. These environments are hot, and contain a mixture of ions and electrons. Low- energy fusion experiments in laboratories are often subject to the target medium, and the current focus is on the use and improvement of radioactive beams to produce the nuclei needed for these reactions [1, 2]. Recreating the stellar environments where these reactions take place is challenging, and hence computational models offer a path to understanding this complex problem. Our unique study showcases a novel method to include the influence of an external physical environment (a plasma) on low- energy fusion reactions, using the theory of open quantum systems. This study suggests that coupling- assisted tunneling in nuclear fusion is strongly enhanced by thermal effects."

The neutron cross sections were weighted with temperaturedependent population probabilities of target's excited states, leading to a stellar enhancement factor. However, these effects were ignored in heavy ion fusion studies, since the reactions of interest would typically involve inert nuclei or nuclei with high excitation energy states of several MeV. In stellar environments, residual heavy nuclei that have low- lying excited states are potential explanations for unaccounted stellar fusion reaction rates."
