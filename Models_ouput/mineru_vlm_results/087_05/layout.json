This is despite the fact that GPS is a proven, robust, and readily available technology. The review highlights how existing vehicular trajectory segmentation methods do not translate well to the field segmentation problem. Common trajectory segmentation policies either require a priori knowledge of machinery operator behavior and their driving patterns; geo- markers from third party sources; or rely on using established road networks. These concepts and methods do not crossover to an agricultural setting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, challenging conjoined field segmentation cases have not been addressed in the current literature. A cost- effective coordinate- based solution to automatically segment agricultural fields is required."

First, the data acquisition from two harvesting implements is outlined in Section III- A. Then, the proposed algorithm is presented in two stages. In Stage I, measurements are preprocessed to determine whether PTO activation has occurred and if road travel has taken place between activation periods, as described in Section III- B. In Stage II, pathways that may be present between adjacent fields in the sampled image are removed by applying a series of morphological image operations. The algorithm then detects the individual field boundaries from the processed image. Finally, the field boundaries are converted back to Cartesian and the machinery coordinate data are labeled as belonging to a particular field, with details given in Section III- C. The method is fully automated, deterministic, and segments all fields in a job site in one pass."
