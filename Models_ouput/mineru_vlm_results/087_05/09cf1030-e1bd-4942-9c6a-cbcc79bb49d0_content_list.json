        "text": "There are a limited number of examples in the literature where field segmentation is performed using machinery coordinate data. This is despite the fact that GPS is a proven, robust, and readily available technology. The review highlights how existing vehicular trajectory segmentation methods do not translate well to the field segmentation problem. Common trajectory segmentation policies either require a priori knowledge of machinery operator behavior and their driving patterns; geo- markers from third party sources; or rely on using established road networks. These concepts and methods do not crossover to an agricultural setting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, challenging conjoined field segmentation cases have not been addressed in the current literature. A cost- effective coordinate- based solution to automatically segment agricultural fields is required.",

        "text": "A coordinate- based method is presented to overcome the challenges highlighted in Section II. First, the data acquisition from two harvesting implements is outlined in Section III- A. Then, the proposed algorithm is presented in two stages. In Stage I, measurements are preprocessed to determine whether PTO activation has occurred and if road travel has taken place between activation periods, as described in Section III- B. In Stage II, pathways that may be present between adjacent fields in the sampled image are removed by applying a series of morphological image operations. The algorithm then detects the individual field boundaries from the processed image. Finally, the field boundaries are converted back to Cartesian and the machinery coordinate data are labeled as belonging to a particular field, with details given in Section III- C. The method is fully automated, deterministic, and segments all fields in a job site in one pass.",

A custom electronic control unit (ECU) was programmed to relay data from the implements across a J1939/CAN network [53] to a Deutz- Fahr Agrotron 6180 [54] and a John Deere 6150R [55]. The machinery was owned and operated by a machinery contractor based in Galway, Ireland, as detailed in [56]. For machinery coordinates, a NEO- M8 GNSS positioning receiver with a wideband GNSS antenna was fitted to the implements [57]. The acquisition frequency of the GNSS is  $1\\mathrm{Hz}$ . PTO speed was measured using an NPN digital hall- effect sensor [50] installed on the implement drivetrain sprocket with a protruding notch. Pulse counts were translated to frequency, which are represented as the PTO rotations per minute (rpm). Fuel usage measurements were obtained from the tractor J1939 interface. The data were stored locally in a document- based database operating on an 8th generation Intel Nuc (Intel i3 processor and 4 GB of RAM) running Ubuntu 16.",
