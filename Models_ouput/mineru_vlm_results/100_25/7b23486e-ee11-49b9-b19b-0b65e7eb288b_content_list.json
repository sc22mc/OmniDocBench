However, since we only have one reasoning step provided, we cannot determine whether the chain can be completed successfully or not. Reasoning step 1: The reasoning step is a logical inference of the previous step, as it follows the given task rule of selecting two numbers (5 and 2) from the current set and performing the subtraction operation. The computed new number is 3, and the remaining numbers are 6 and 6. The new set becomes 3, 6. This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it reduces the number of elements in the set and provides a new number for further operations.
