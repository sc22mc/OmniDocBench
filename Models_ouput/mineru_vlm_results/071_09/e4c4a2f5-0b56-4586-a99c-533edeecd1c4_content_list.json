The equivalent of Remark 4.3 for  $D > 4$  is that there are no cubic fields of discriminant  $3^{4}D$  when we are in the non- escalator case, i.e. when  $r_3(D) = r_3(D')$ . Since Lemma 4.5 and Proposition 4.8 hold for this case as well, we see that the subfamily of curves  $E_{D'}$  with  $D > 4$  and  $r_3(D) = r_3(D')$  has no integral points.",
