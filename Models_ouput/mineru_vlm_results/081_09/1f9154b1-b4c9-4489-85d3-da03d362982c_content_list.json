            "Figure 8. Comparison of the total, summed final abundances of all nuclides with mass  $A \\geq 150$  (representative of the strength of any r-process taking place) with the quantity  $s^3 / Y_3^3 \\tau_d$  evaluated when seed formation begins. The relationship between  $s^3 / Y_3^3 \\tau_d$  and  $Y_H$  is necessarily approximate due to the presence of wave heating during seed formation. The relationship found in Hoffman et al. (1997) was derived under the assumption of constant entropy, which is not generally true in our models. Nevertheless, we still observe a strong correlation between the two quantities, which helps to provide a qualitative explanation for the variation in heavy element nucleosynthesis near  $L_w / L_\\nu = 10^{-3}$ . These results are for the same parameters as those in figure 7, with a finer grid in  $L_w / L_\\nu$ ."
