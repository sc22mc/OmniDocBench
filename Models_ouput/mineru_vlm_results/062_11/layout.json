AR- enabled technologies (beyond current AR headsets) are expected to be utilized in the near future for providing guidance to the drivers [69], [70], [71], increasing their situational awareness, and facilitating cooperation with other vehicles and road users (e.g., pedestrians, bicycles). The main purpose of the proposed system is to be capable to provide in real- time information to the drivers of autonomous and connected vehicles in cooperative driving situations, in order to increase their situational awareness."
