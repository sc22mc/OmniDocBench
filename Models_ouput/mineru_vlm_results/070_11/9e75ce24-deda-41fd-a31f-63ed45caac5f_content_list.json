Especially below about  $5\\mathrm{K}$ , the actual sample temperature crucially depends on the thermal contact, increasing its error as compared to higher temperatures. The spectral intensity was normalized by the incoming photon intensity  $(I_0)$ . We used circularly polarized light at both beamlines.

SO coupling constants were kept to the Hartree- Fock values [47].  $\\Delta = E(d^{n + 1}\\underline{L}) - E(d^n)$ ,  $U_{dd}$  and  $U_{pd}$  were directly fitted to the experimental spectra, keeping  $U_{dd} / U_{pd} = 0.8$  [85- 88]. Experiments involving charge- neutral excitations such as XAS are only weakly sensitive to  $\\Delta$ ,  $U_{dd}$  and  $U_{pd}$ . In our particular case we were fitting simultaneously XAS and XMCD spectra, which substantially mitigates these kind of problems. Our results are in good agreement with values reported for (Ga,Mn)As [89- 93] and Mn- doped Bi2Se3 [55] and Bi2Te3 [94]. The other MLFT input parameters were estimated from DFT, and their values were subsequently adjusted to reproduce the experimental spectra. To simplify the calculation, instead of the trigonal  $C_{3v}$  we work in  $O_{h}$  symmetry, with the  $C_{4}$  octahedral axes along the Mn- Te bonds, which has a negligible impact: Our simplification neglects the splitting of the  $t_{2g}$  orbitals, which is tiny compared to  $10Dq< 100\\mathrm{meV}$ , which in turn is smaller than the experimental resolution.",

To circumvent the difficulties related to this overlap, one can obtain  $m_{\\mathrm{XM}}^{\\mathrm{spin}}$  by a comparison of the experimental XMCD asymmetry at the  $L_{3}$  peak to the theoretical one calculated from MLFT spectra of comparable line width [52- 54].",
