In crop rotation, ginger cultivation is done by rotating with nonhost crops that are not susceptible to ginger- specific diseases. For instance, a cycle of 2- 4 years of rotation of ginger crops and other crops, such as paddy, potato, and mustard, was reported in [59]. This helps in reducing pathogen load in the soil, thereby disrupting the life cycle of soilborne pathogens. This requires good management from the farmers. Aside from crop rotation, intercropping, which is the practice of growing two or more crops in proximity, offers several benefits to ginger cultivation [62], [63]. This is due to some factors, such as improvement of soil structure, reduction in the spread of soilborne diseases, and reduction in light intensity [65]. The use of sanitation involves maintaining a high level of hygiene to prevent the spread of diseases [61]. The infected plants are destroyed, while tools and equipment are properly cleaned to avoid cross contamination. In the soil management method, good drainage systems are put in place to avoid water logging [64]. This helps prevent root and rhizome rot. Effective irrigation method, such as drip or furrow irrigation, which delivers water directly to the root zone, helps reduce the spread of fungal diseases. While these cultural practices have proved to be successful, ginger",
