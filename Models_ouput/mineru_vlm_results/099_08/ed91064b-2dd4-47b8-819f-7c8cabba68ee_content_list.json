The Spearman and Pearson correlations with GPT- 4's ranking on the leaderboard are 0.97 and 0.96 respectively (Fig. 5), and we show detailed ranking in Tab. 24.

We conclude that our model does not sacrifice the pairwise comparison performance for supporting multiple evaluation protocols and generating supporting explanations. (2) Using the same pairwise training data, we train a standard reward model to output a scalar rating for each query- response pair (its agreement rate on Eval- P is 54.5). We conduct best- of- 32 response selection experiments. As shown in Tab. 3, despite not being directly optimized for a scalar output, AUTO- J achieves comparable performance to reward model.
