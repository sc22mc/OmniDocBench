The prompt, as illustrated in Listing 2, consists of a task description along with three specific examples. We supply GPT- 4 with a text, a prompt, and two distinct model- generated responses. The task for GPT- 4 is to determine the superior answer or recognize a tie. The chosen examples encompass scenarios where Assistant A performs better, Assistant B performs better, and when a tie occurs. This methodology enables us to effectively assess the model's quality. Specially, the orders where the model responses are presented to the GPT- 4 are swapped randomly to alleviate bias, as Touvron et al. (2023b) did.",
