Therefore, we obtain  $\\tau = 0.66$ . For the  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) line we obtain  $\\tau = 0.44$  using  $T_{\\mathrm{MB}} = 1.0$  and  $T_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 7 \\mathrm{K}$ . Through a combination of excitation and abundance, distinctive species give complementary information on gas conditions. Due to its relatively high abundance and low critical density  $n_{\\mathrm{cr}}(\\mathrm{C^{18}O}(2 - 1)) \\sim 10^{4} \\mathrm{cm}^{- 3}$ , computed with numbers in the LAMDA database,  ${}^{3} \\mathrm{C^{18}O}(2 - 1)$  is a sensitive tracer of relatively low- density material in the cloud, which traces the more extended gas in the filamentary structure. The  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) molecule, on the other hand, presents a higher critical density  $n_{\\mathrm{cr}}(\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}(3 - 2)) \\sim 10^{6} \\mathrm{cm}^{- 3}$ , which makes it more selective of dense gas closer to the central protostar.  $\\mathrm{DCO^{+}}$  (3- 2) emission is also known as a remarkably sensitive tracer for gas properties during the early stages of protostellar evolution (e.g., Gerner et al. 2015). In the location of the protostar, we see a decrease in the  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}(2 - 1)$  integrated intensity, suggesting that the molecule is partially depleted onto the dust grains (Caselli et al. 1999) (Bacmann et al. 2002). Figure 2 shows the channel maps of the  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}(2 - 1)$  line. The figure presents the signal emission at velocity intervals of  $\\approx 0.2 \\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$ .",

Since the line is optically thin, as shown in Sect. 3, we are confident that these are multiple velocity components and they are not due to self- absorption. In order to fit two Gaussian profiles on the  $\\mathrm{C^{18}O}(2 - 1)$  data we perform a simple  $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{N}$  cut, we mask those pixels where  $T_{\\mathrm{MB}}^{\\mathrm{peak}} < 20$ , then fit one Gaussian profile to all the unmasked pixels (65% of the pixels). Then we fit two Gaussians for those pixels that had a residual larger than  $2 \\times rms$  and those Gaussian fits with a width broader than  $0.25 \\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$  in the previous step. By visual inspection we find that lines broader than  $0.25 \\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$  show profiles consistent with two velocity components on the line of sight. For the second time we check the Gaussian fit profiles and for those pixels that have residuals bigger than  $2 \\times rms$  we do the fitting one more time with different initial guesses (60% of the pixels with  $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{N}$  cut), which means they always have residuals less than two times the rms. As a final step, if the error on the velocity dispersion or velocity and on the amplitude is larger than  $1 \\mathrm{km} \\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$  and  $1 \\mathrm{K}$ , respectively, we remove the fit. By doing this, we remove fits with unreasonably large uncertainties, which indicates that they have been poorly fitted. Figure 3 shows the fit results overlapped with the data.",
