If there are two secant planes that contain  $w$  , 6 points of  $X$  do not satisfy the independent condition of 5- very ampleness.(cf. 5 Remark 1.7) So, there exists a unique plane spanned by three points of  $X$  that contains  $w$  .Let  $x,y$  , and  $\\mathcal{E}$  be three distinct points of  $X$  such that their linear span contains  $w$  .Let  $a,b$  , and  $\\mathcal{C}$  be the points of intersection of  $\\overline{uw}$  with  $\\overline{yz}$ $\\overline{yw}$  with  $\\overline{zx}$  , and  $\\overline{zw}$  with  $\\overline{xy}$  , respectively. Then, the three points of the ruled join  $J(X,Y)$  corresponding to the ratios between  $(x,w),(w,a),(y,w),(w,b)$  , and  $(z,w),(w,c)$  are exactly the inverse image of the rational map  $J(X,Y)\\to XY$",
