Since the present calculations only include excited states of the  $^{188}$  Os ground- state rotational band, the spin degeneracy factors in Eq. (4) will be irrelevant. Excited states are thermally populated before the target and projectile interact with each other and thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed at the start of the reaction [19, 20]. As known from coupled channels calculations, coupling of the radial motion to energy eigenstates can cause changes in fusion probability. Population of excited states in either the target or projectile nucleus due to surface vibrations or rotational excited states lead to an overall increase in fusion probability due to coherent coupled channels effects [21]. For the dynamical calculations, we use the same equation of motion for the density matrix of the reduced system as the one used in Ref. [18], Eq. (5). This method uses the Lindblad master equation, allowing coupling between the radial and energy eigenstate bases, and uses Lindblad operators to introduce novel effects into the calculation. An energy projection technique is used to calculate the fusion probability for specific collision energies [18].",

Hence we only consider the ground state of  $^{16}$  O and the ground and first excited state of  $^{188}$  Os. The parameters used in these calculations are the same as in Ref.

The relevant rates for this work are shown in Table I, and were calculated using the ISOMEX code [25], which is based on the relativistic average atom model and assumes local thermal equilibrium. The considered excitation processes due to NPIs are: resonant photon absorption, inelastic electron scattering, NEEC and NEET. The de- excitation processes include spontaneous photon emission, induced photon emission, internal conversion, bound internal conversion (BIC), and super- elastic electron scattering. Since the excited state of  $^{188}$  Os is much higher than the binding energy of the K- shell atomic orbitals, NEET and BIC do not contribute to the plasma induced nuclear transition rates.",
