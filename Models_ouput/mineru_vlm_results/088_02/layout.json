Arable farming is the large-scale cultivation of plants, such as wheat, potatoes, oilseeds, and fiber crops that are harvested at the same time. \n2) Horticultural production on a small scale involves the production of fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants, such as tomatoes, apples, cucumbers, and cabbage, which require selective harvesting. \n3) Animal husbandry is the practice of breeding, feeding, and caring for animals, such as livestock, poultry, and fish. Examples of animal husbandry activities include watering, and milking of dairy animals, as well as shearing and processing wool."

These uncertainties make it difficult for robots to predict and adapt to changes. \n2) Crop variability: Each crop is unique and has different characteristics that can make it difficult for robots to handle them. Crop variability can include differences in size, shape, and texture, which can impact the robot's ability to identify and pick crops. \n3) Obstacles and terrain: Agricultural fields can have various obstacles and terrains, such as rocks, trees, and uneven ground. These uncertainties make it difficult for robots to navigate and avoid obstacles. \n4) Sensor and hardware limitations: Robotic systems require sensors and hardware to operate effectively. However, these components can have limitations in terms of accuracy, precision, and range. These uncertainties can impact the overall performance of the robot. \n5) Data quality and quantity: Agricultural data can be difficult to collect and may vary in quality and quantity. This uncertainty can impact the robot's ability to make informed decisions. \n6) Regulatory challenges: Agricultural robots must comply with various regulations and standards set by governments and other regulatory bodies.
