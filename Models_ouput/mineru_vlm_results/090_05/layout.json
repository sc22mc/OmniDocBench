For this reason, the obtained electrical parameters were then employed in this study to determine the statistical difference between control and iron- deficient plants.

A comparable behavior to the one observed in the time analysis of fixed- frequency impedance presented in Fig. 2 is noticeable in the CPE- P component, presented in Fig. 4(c), where a deviation over time between control and iron- stressed plants is clearly visible. Such behavior is potentially due to the metabolic variation of the plant to adapt to iron deficiency [38], which affects the integrity of the cellular structures, and thus, their ability to act as capacitors for the current flowing during the bioimpedance measurement.
