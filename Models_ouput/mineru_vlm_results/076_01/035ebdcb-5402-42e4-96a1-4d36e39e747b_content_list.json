        "text": "Abstract—Automated vehicles (AVs) are tested in diverse scenarios, typically specified by parameters such as velocities, distances, or curve radii. To describe scenarios uniformly independent of such parameters, this paper proposes a vectorized scenario description defined by the road geometry and vehicles' trajectories. Data of this form are generated for three scenarios, merged, and used to train the motion prediction model VectorNet, allowing to predict an AV's trajectory for unseen scenarios. Predicting scenario evaluation metrics, VectorNet partially achieves lower errors than regression models that separately process the three scenarios' data. However, for comprehensive generalization, sufficient variance in the training data must be ensured. Thus, contrary to existing methods, our proposed method can merge diverse scenarios' data and exploit spatial and temporal nuances in the vectorized scenario description. As a result, data from specified test scenarios and real- world scenarios can be compared and combined for (predictive) analyses and scenario selection.",

Thus, search- based techniques systematically vary scenarios and provoke critical behaviors [4]. Here, scenario- based testing provides the framework for variation [5]. First, a functional scenario is described in natural language, e.g., \"The AV (Ego) follows a curved road\". An associated logical scenario specifies open parameters and their ranges, e.g.,  $v_{\\mathrm{Ego}} \\in [8 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}}, 16 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}} ]$ . Finally, concrete scenarios, e.g.,  $v_{\\mathrm{Ego}} = 9 \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}}$ , are parameterized within the logical scenario. Here, data of executed concrete scenarios are used to perform predictive analyses for further concrete scenarios and select relevant concrete scenarios for execution.",

Conventional techniques for predictive analyses cannot be used across logical and functional scenarios as their parameters vary considerably. Thus, the search for relevant concrete scenarios starts anew for each functional and logical scenario. Furthermore, real- world scenarios may only be described inadequately by parameters since, e.g., the road geometry can be arbitrarily complex [6]–[8]. Thus, it is unclear what behavior to expect in real- world tests, and the comparison of AVs' behavior in tests and real- world scenarios is restricted.",

For a specific functional scenario, different logical scenarios can exist if influences are modeled differently in different test setups or are not controllable. E.g., fog may be modeled by noise in a 2D simulation, rendered in a 3D simulation, or real but not controllable in a field test. Due to their open nature, logical scenarios cannot be directly processed but they provide the structure for predictive analyses and search- based techniques.",
