Specifically, we detailed computer vision techniques for effectively detecting the BMSB, primarily on RGB images captured by UAVs, as well as utilizing spectral imaging as a complementary strategy. We also proposed an edge- based smart IoT sticky trap with integrated cameras and running resource efficient algorithms to be used in conjunction with the entire monitoring system to estimate population of specific invasive insect species. Finally, we successfully applied computer vision algorithms to spectral imaging to detect punctures on harvested pears, which can be integrated into a fruit sorting system to optimize food quality on the shelves of supply to customers. In addition, we developed a client- server application to enrich the dataset and enhance the trained models within this system."
