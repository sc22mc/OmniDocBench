Among the various food items to be inspected, fruits play a key role. Furthermore, the reduction of fruit waste through its correct quality evaluation is especially relevant in the agri- food industry to reduce financial loss [1] and to improve food security and sustainability. Fruit sorting methods taking into consideration both internal and external qualities and flaws are essential throughout all postharvesting stages. In this context, significant challenges arise from mishandling, freezing, and transportation- related damages [2], [3]. To address this, the industry employs sorting techniques to identify unsuitable fruits for market or storage. To date, accurate determination of fruit quality is based on both destructive and nondestructive methods. While destructive methods typically require long times and are not appropriate for large- scale measurements, nondestructive procedures provide instantaneous outcomes and are more desirable."

Optical techniques, such as colorimetry [4], imaging [5], and spectroscopy, provide insights into the internal structure of fruit through interaction with light. Alternatively, the interaction of an electric field with the fruit presents a new approach to the measurement of fruit quality. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), also called bioimpedance, allows measuring the passive electrical properties of a sample in response to an applied electromagnetic field [6]. While both approaches offer fast and efficient measurements, bioimpedance represents a low- cost and promising approach compared to conventional optical methods. Such impedance measurement techniques can be classified as contact and noncontact. Extensive research has been conducted on non- destructive contact methods for fruits, such as bananas [7], apples [8], [9], strawberries [10], and mangoes [11]. However, with the increasing demand for real- time fruit quality detection in industrial settings, the development of fast, nondestructive, and noncontact detection systems has become crucial [12]."
