The product is a field object that is not fully formed. The remaining steps of Stage II cannot function correctly. The result is several foreground areas that do not meet the minimum area requirement to be considered valid fields, as seen in Fig. 9(c). Similarly, the operator does not loop the field perimeter for the single field site shown in Fig. 10. However, in this scenario, the job site is detected as a conjoined field site and over- segmented by the algorithm, and thus labeled as a false positive."
