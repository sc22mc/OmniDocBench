The study from [46] shows that temperature and rainfall have a significant impact on the pest population. Some of the identified pests affecting ginger are rhizome scale, shoot borer, root- knot nematodes, leaf roller, white grub, and rhizome fly [46], [47], [48]. The rhizome scale is a small, round, and brownish insect that feeds on the sap of ginger rhizomes. Affected plants show stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and reduced vigor. The shoot borer is a moth whose larvae bore into the ginger shoots, causing significant damage. Affected plants show holes in the stems, and the central shoot often collapses. The root- knot nematodes are microscopic worms that infest the roots of ginger plants. Infested plants exhibit stunted growth, yellowing of leaves, and formation of characteristic galls on the roots. The leaf roller is a caterpillar that feeds on ginger leaves, causing them to roll up and form protective shelters. The caterpillars roll the leaves longitudinally and feed inside the rolled leaves, leading to reduced photosynthetic area and poor plant growth. Affected leaves show feeding damage and may become dry and brittle."

The leaf becomes folded or rolled longitudinally and complete defoliation can take place in severe conditions. The white grub occasionally feeds on tender rhizomes, roots, and base of pseudostems, causing yellowing and wilting of shoots. The rhizome flies are fairly large with slender bodies and long legs. The body is black and the wings are transparent with ashy spots. The pests play significant roles in the dissemination of fungal and bacterial phytopathogens. Moreover, they create entry wounds, which facilitate easier entry for these pathogens. Table I provides a summary of the ginger diseases and pests."
