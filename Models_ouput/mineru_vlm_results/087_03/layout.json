An example of a conjoined field job site is shown in Fig. 2(a). The fields are conjoined by the operator moving between the adjacent fields via a short, off- road pathway. Segmentation is the process of detecting the individual field boundaries in a job site and labeling positional data as belonging to a particular field. The contributions of this article is as follows."

The algorithm is evaluated with data from two unique harvesting implements, highlighting how the method may be used with other types of implements. \n3) The deterministic algorithm is designed to segment agricultural machinery trajectory data without the use of machine learning methods. \n4) The results demonstrate that the algorithm can solve for both road-to-field and field-to-field segmentation cases. \n5) No additional labor, land traversal, or aerial surveillance is necessary to produce the results shown, offering a cost-effective, straightforward solution to existing mechanized practices."

Operators must conform to these constraints and obtain adequate training, which incurs an additional labor cost in addition to the operating expenses of the aircraft."
