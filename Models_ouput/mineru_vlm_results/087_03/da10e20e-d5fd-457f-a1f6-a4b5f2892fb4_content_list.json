An example of a conjoined field job site is shown in Fig. 2(a). The fields are conjoined by the operator moving between the adjacent fields via a short, off- road pathway. Segmentation is the process of detecting the individual field boundaries in a job site and labeling positional data as belonging to a particular field.

The algorithm is evaluated with data from two unique harvesting implements, highlighting how the method may be used with other types of implements. \n3) The deterministic algorithm is designed to segment agricultural machinery trajectory data without the use of machine learning methods. \n4) The results demonstrate that the algorithm can solve for both road-to-field and field-to-field segmentation cases. \n5) No additional labor, land traversal, or aerial surveillance is necessary to produce the results shown, offering a cost-effective, straightforward solution to existing mechanized practices.",

[27] demonstrate their method using time- series satellite images covering a study area of  $4000\\mathrm{km}^2$ . Provided the images are updated frequently, or the field boundary is static, remote sensing enables for preemptive mapping before the machinery enters. A situation may arise where an operator decides to erect a temporary fence within a field, or decide to only fertilize a part of the field. In these scenarios, the job parameters have changed, and the historic remote sensing geofence may require alteration to fit the completed job. Furthermore, fine and transitory boundaries, such as an electric fence, would be imperceptible to low- resolution satellite cameras. Satellite images are available to the public through the European Space Agency Sentinel- 2 project. Sentinel- 2 offers a resolution of up to  $10\\mathrm{m}$  with a revisit frequency of five days at the Equator [30]. However, to obtain images of sufficient spatial resolution, frequent image acquisition from commercial satellites may be required.",
