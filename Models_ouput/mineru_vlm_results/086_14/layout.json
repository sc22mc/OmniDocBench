However, the analyses of the individual organs such as root, stem, leaf, ear, and fruit need to be carried out in greenhouses, fields, and sometimes in laboratories to perform early disease detection. Canopy- level measurements are performed for severity assessment to translate the detected diseases into the severity ranks [17]. Canopy- level measurements indicate assessments at the plant canopy level, which includes all the leaves and stems above the ground [17]. The analysis of hyperspectral images of the entire canopy can aid the researchers in translating the detected disease symptoms into severity ranks and provides valuable insights into plant diseases [17]. The following case studies of selected plant diseases briefly discuss the application of hyperspectral images used for disease diagnosis."

[148] proposed multivariate methods, which involve partial linear regression, support vector regression, and gaussian process regression to identify the yellow rust diseases at the leaf and canopy level. The results showed promising performance in detecting diseases at an early stage. Bohnenkamp et al. [144] conducted an experiment to detect yellow rust and brown rust on wheat plants from hyperspectral images of wheat leaves. The investigation was conducted in a laboratory at the leaf level and with controlled environmental conditions. The images are analyzed by using least- squares factorization so that the spectral information for yellow and brown rust can be identified. This study aided in understanding the pathogenic properties of the diseases by using an explicable disintegration of the spectral reflectance analysis [144]. Powdery mildew is another contagious disease in wheat plants that starts as light white pustules on wheat leaves. However, very few studies were conducted to detect powdery mildew diseases from the hyperspectral images. One such study was conducted at the Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences Field. The study collected 114 plant leaf samples, including infected leaves (80 leaves) and healthy leaves (34 leaves), by remote sensing devices. The images were then analyzed using regression models, which could detect the leaf diseases very well [296]. One study regarding the leaf spot disease for maize was conducted in [151]. The experiment was carried out with an Analytical Spectral Device FieldSpec 3 spectrometer in a Cedara experimental field area of South Africa. Two spectral regions, "
