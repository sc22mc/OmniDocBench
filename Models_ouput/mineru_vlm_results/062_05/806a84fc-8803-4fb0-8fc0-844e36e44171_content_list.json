Assuming point clouds without context information, saliency characterizes the geometric properties in a local neighborhood of points, i.e., high saliency values represent more perceptually prominent vertices which usually correspond to sharp corners (high- frequency spatial information). On the opposite, the geometrically least important points are those that lie in flat areas.",

Instead of using guided normals of centroids, as in the original version [33], we now utilize normals for the points. This was performed to accelerate computations. Since the number of faces is usually approximately twice the number of vertices, the point normals are almost half the number of the centroid normals. For the sake of completeness, we present here our approach for the estimation of the saliency map of a point cloud scene, utilizing point normals.",

The method processes each frame independently without examining past temporal information.
