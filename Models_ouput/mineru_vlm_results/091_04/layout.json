This representative section indicates temperature impacts the dielectric constant of the materials (i.e., air and sample under test), which in turn affects capacitance. Such behavior can be explained by the fact that the mobility of polar molecules is increased at higher temperatures, which raises the dielectric constant of the measuring materials [28]. Compensation for the data based on temperature is needed to mitigate the effect of temperature on the samples. A linear regression model was fitted to the first 18 data points (excluding the first six data points), yielding an r- squared value of "

The series capacitance decreases over time, indicating the aging of the sample. The decrease in series capacitance over time in the fruit can be attributed to factors, such as water content. During the ripening process of fruits, the water content gradually decreases, leading to an increase in impedance [29]. This decrease in water content is one of the factors contributing to the decrease in capacitance. However, it is important to note that the value of capacitance is not solely determined by water content but is primarily influenced by the degradation of the cell membrane. From an electrical perspective, the decrease in capacitance over time can be attributed to the degradation of the capacitive behavior of the cell membrane of the biological sample. This degradation allows for easier passage of current through the intra and extracellular space of fruit [30]."
