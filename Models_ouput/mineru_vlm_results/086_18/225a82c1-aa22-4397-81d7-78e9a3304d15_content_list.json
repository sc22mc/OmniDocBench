        "text": "4) Several researchers have attempted to use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to preprocess the hyperspectral images and then detect and classify the diseases. However, one common challenge for computer-aided algorithms is that it requires good quality and a large amount of data to process the hyperspectral images. If a smaller dataset is used, the results might be biased and unable to detect the diseases well. Therefore, during the data acquisition period, a good-quality camera and a large amount of data (approximately  $10\\mathrm{k}$  above) should be collected so that the models do not face overfitting issues.",

        "text": "5) The data processing of hyperspectral imaging is also complex and computationally expensive, which can impede timely analysis [316], [317]. Methods such as PCA, used in the feature extraction part, can be computationally demanding to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional hyperspectral data [318]. In addition, machine learning techniques for regression and classification (such as SVM or RF) can increase the need for high computational power and time. This reduces the chance of being implemented in real-time/resource-limited settings, such as crop monitoring [319], [320]. One potential solution to overcome these issues could be employing parallel processing to manage computational load and reduce computational time by ensuring the data integrity and accuracy of the",

Hyperspectral imaging is a nondestructive, fast, reliable technique that can be employed to detect plant diseases. With the advent of such technologies, human perceptions are extending further to the visible spectrum [17]. This aids in classifying the infected plants, assessing and analyzing the disease severity, classifying the pathogens, and detecting the early symptoms of plant diseases before the human eyes can detect them.",

The current systems are capable of detecting diseases when they are visibly infested. Hence, developing remote sensing platforms that can monitor the disease growth at the emerging stages is crucial. The placement of sensors or the distance between the sensors and the diseased plants is one of the crucial factors for image analysis. This is because the distance of the sensor is directly related to the spatial resolution",
