In the second step, the even frames are predicted from the odd frames by a prediction operator  $\\mathcal{P}$ . Subtracting the predicted values  $\\mathcal{P}(l_{2t - 1})$  from the even frames, results in the HP coefficients  $h_{2t}$ . In the third step, the HP coefficients are filtered by an update operator  $\\mathcal{U}$  and are added back to the odd frames, resulting in the LP coefficients. To get coarser temporal resolutions, the lifting scheme can be iterated on the LP subband by  $i_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\log_2(T)$  decomposition levels, where  $T$  equals the total number of original frames.",

By introducing rounding operators as introduced in [8], integer to integer transforms can be achieved, which yield perfect reconstruction. This makes the lifting structure of the WT highly attractive for many professional applications by offering a scalable representation and lossless reconstruction at the same time. However, due to temporal displacements in the sequence, blurriness and ghosting artifacts will appear in the LP subband. These can be alleviated by incorporating MC methods directly into the lifting structure without losing the property of perfect reconstruction. This is called motion compensated temporal filtering (MCTF) [9] and can be achieved by realizing the prediction operator  $\\mathcal{P}$  by the warping operator  $\\mathcal{W}_{2t - 1\\rightarrow 2t}$ . Instead of the original odd frames, a compensated version is subtracted from the even frames. In case of the Haar wavelet filters, the prediction step is given by",

If there are no changes over several frames, they shall be represented by only one LP frame.

The corresponding amount of motion is described by the legend on the right side of Fig. [2] While in this example the first decomposition is performed for the entire sequence, the second decomposition is performed only on the frames with no or low motion. The third decomposition is exclusively done on frames with no motion. The resulting BL and ELs are marked at the right side. Since the maximum decomposition level  $i_{\\mathrm{max}}$  is equal to 3, three ELs are generated.
