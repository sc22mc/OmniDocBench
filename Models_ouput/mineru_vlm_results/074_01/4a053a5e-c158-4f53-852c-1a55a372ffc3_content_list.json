The goal of this is to illustrate when the growth rate, and by extension the infectiousness, can be accurately measured in a new outbreak, e.g. after introduction of a new variant of a virus. We find that as long as susceptible depletion is a minor effect, the transients are gone within around 4 generations.",

It is therefore essential to understand when an outbreak actually follows the largest eigenvalue, and, by extension, when the Corrections to the exponential growth from other effects such as spatial spread have already been investigated [4,14], whereas this paper will focus on the convergence to the eigenstate. This is of particular interest when comparing the relative infectiousness of a emerging new variant versus existing variants, see for instance [15].",
