While single- frequency measurements are quick and straightforward, frequency sweeps, as in this study and in [14], [15], and [17], detect small variations across frequencies, although requiring more time. The choice between frequency range and single- frequency measurement depends on specific measurement goals. Overall, this method presents a novel approach to fruit quality investigation.",

The investigation focused on two setups: first, a preliminary trial including four bananas and soap, and secondly, the examination of 51 nectarines. Both cases yielded promising results with the noncontact capacitive measurement method. During the initial setup, spanning seven days, the noncontact technique effectively observed the banana's aging process, showing a noticeable decline in series capacitance  $(C_{s})$  with time. This sensitivity to biological changes allowed clear differentiation between the aging banana and the stable soap. Moreover, the correlation between capacitance and temperature underscored the necessity for temperature correction during data processing.",

        "text": "To explore temperature effects, simultaneous measurements of sample presence and absence were conducted, unveiling the impact of aging and environmental factors on system response. This innovative approach presents a means to mitigate temperature and other influences effectively. In addition, by analyzing  $C_{s}$  response to banana sample mass loss, the method acknowledges the role of biochemical changes over time in assessing fruit quality. In setup 2, the noncontact technique assessed mechanical damage in 51 nectarines, revealing an immediate increase in  $C_{s}$  postdamage, followed by a subsequent decrease after  $24\\mathrm{h}$ . This dynamic response reflects complex cellular alterations triggered by mechanical damage, including cell content leakage and membrane integrity changes. The method's ability to discern damaged fruit, even  $24\\mathrm{h}$  postdamage, suggests real- time quality evaluation feasibility in industrial settings.",
