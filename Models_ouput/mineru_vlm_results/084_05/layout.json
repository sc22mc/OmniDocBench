SAC augments the maximum reward objective, foundation of RL settings, with an entropy maximization term. Such term acts as a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, so that the agent aims to maximize its return while also acting as random as possible. In circumstances where multiple actions seem equally attractive, i.e. in the case of equal or close Q-Values, the learned policy is encouraged to assign equal probability mass to those actions."

The entropy term can be either fixed or optimized/learned as further steps are taken. However, the optimal entropy coefficient varies depending on a series of factors, such as the nature of the task or even the current policy. As a consequence, it is usually considered good practice to avoid fixed values, preferring instead to update the term at the same time actor, critic, and the target networks are optimized [7]."

The literature has shown that ML models can accurately distinguish between packet loss attributable to congestion or channel errors. We plan to integrate a similar classifier within MARLIN and investigate the feasibility of an analogous approach to identify variations in end- to- end latency that are caused by changes in the path to destination. The fundamental building block of CC algorithms is how and when to change the CwND size. MARLIN currently actively controls the \"how\", leaving the \"when\" to a heuristic. We will investigate learning- based approaches to include such decision factor into MARLIN, with the goal of turning it into a more comprehensive and reactive system, able to make rational decisions at its own tempo."
