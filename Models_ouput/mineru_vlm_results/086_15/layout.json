Hence, to overcome this issue, a wide variety of images of leaves, stems, and fruits from different angles should be taken and annotated by experts in the fields. Once the annotated images are trained with computer- aided models, the models can also identify unidentified images. Generally, disease classification can be broadly divided into two categories: 1) classification based on selected wavelengths of hyperspectral images and 2) classification based on full- spectrum information of hyperspectral images. The classification based on selected wavelengths includes feature selection techniques, which involve the selection of specific wavelengths or bands to differentiate between healthy and diseased plants. This category often includes statistical analysis, vegetation indices [such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)], and discriminant analysis. The selection of relevant wavelengths can improve the accuracy and provide more insights into classifications [301]. On the other hand, feature extraction is a technique that translates the original data into a new set of features to capture the essential information concisely. Feature extraction can combine multiple wavelengths of information to create new features representing important classification characteristics. The main aim is to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve classification performance [302]. Hence, feature extraction techniques complement: 1) classification based on selected wavelengths of hyperspectral images and 2) classification based on full- spectrum information of hyperspectral image categories."
