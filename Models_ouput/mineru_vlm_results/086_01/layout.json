Every year, plant diseases result in significant crop losses that threaten the global food supply chain. Early estimation of plant diseases could play an essential role in safeguarding crops and fostering economic growth. Recently, hyperspectral imaging techniques have emerged as powerful tools for early disease detection, as they have demonstrated capabilities to detect plant diseases from tissue to canopy levels. This article provides an extensive overview of the principles, types, and operating platforms of hyperspectral image sensors. Furthermore, this article delves into the specifics of these sensors' application in plant disease detection, including disease identification, classification, severity analysis, and understanding genetic resistance. In addition, this article addresses the current challenges in the field and suggests potential solutions to mitigate these pressing issues. Finally, this article outlines the promising future trends and directions of hyperspectral imaging in plant disease detection and analysis. With continuous improvement and application, these imaging techniques have great potential to revolutionize plant disease management, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security."

Visual detection of plant disease also depends upon the expertise to identify the clear visibility/symptoms of the plants, which indicates that the plant has already been infected. Often plant diseases or infections usually outsets in a small region of leaves. The visual inspection process by farmers or plant pathologists is not sufficient as it is very hard to identify those smaller infected regions with the naked eye. Hence, identifying plant diseases at an early stage is crucial as it allows for early intercession to control and impede the spread of the infection to other parts/plants before the entire harvest is damaged. Early plant disease detection could also aid agronomists in using the specific application of chemicals, reducing excessive abuse of chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, and so on. This can directly benefit the plant ecosystem and environment and manage the expenditures for the plant pathologists [7]. Therefore, there is a growing demand in the agriculture industry for automating the manual inspection process with a sophisticated, efficient, and robust approach."
