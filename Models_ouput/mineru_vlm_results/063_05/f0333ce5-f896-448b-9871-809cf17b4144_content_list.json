For instance, if  $1\\leq \\ell_0\\leq 6$  then Conjecture  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  is true (see, Corollary 2.3 4.4 and 4.5). Combining the results computed in [MZS14], Theorem  $\\boxed{\\mathbf{A}}$  confirms the validity of Conjecture  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  for a large range of  $\\ell_0$  . For instance, if  $\\ell_0$  is prime power satisfying  $\\ell_0< 16411$  or if it has two distinct prime divisors such that  $\\ell_0< 8197$  then Conjecture  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  is true for prime numbers  $p$  with  $\\ell_0$  satisfying properties just stated (see Theorem  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  and Theorem  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  for more cases).",

In Section  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  we fix some notations and discuss some well- known facts related to Equation  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$ . In particular, by applying Hasse- Weil bound, we give a proof of the facts that Equation  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  is solvable over  $\\mathbb{F}_q$  in the case where  $1\\leq \\ell \\leq 4$  (Corollary  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$ . Then, we collect and prove necessary results that are needed in the proof of the main result in Section  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$ . One of the key ingredients is Ramanujan's sum which we recall in Lemma 3.2. Section  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  is devoted to the proof of Theorem  $\\boxed{\\mathbf{A}}$ . By appropriately organizing the character sum in the expression for the number of solutions to Equation  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$ , we are able to obtain the desired bound given in Theorem  $\\boxed{\\mathbf{A}}$  for the number of solutions. In the final section, we apply our main result to the problem of the size of optimal CAC and deduce a large range of  $\\ell_0$  such that Conjecture  $\\boxed{ \\begin{array}{r l} \\end{array} }$  (as well as Conjecture  $\\boxed{\\mathbf{B}}$  and  $\\boxed{\\mathbf{A}}$  ) hold.",
