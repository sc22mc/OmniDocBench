In sections 3 and 4 we presented core idea of our method and provided an example that illustrates it. As the ciphertext in that method consists of  $n$  copies of the same automaton, those two sections are included to so the reader could understand the method presented in section 5. It should be also mentioned that lemmas 4 and 3 are only examples of extensions of that cryptosystem. Indeed, observe that Lemma 4 provides a possibility to add \"free\"  $a$ - clusters to a ciphertext. The disadvantage of that extension is that",
