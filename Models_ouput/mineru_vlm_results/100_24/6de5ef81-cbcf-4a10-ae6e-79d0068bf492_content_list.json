The final result obtained in the last step is 24, which is a mathematically equal to the target number 24.\nStep 1: This step is a logical inference of the given numbers and the goal of the game. The selected two numbers, 4 and 10, are multiplied to obtain the new number 40. The remaining numbers, 5 and 11, are correctly included in the new set. This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it reduces the number of elements in the new set. This step is a logical inference of the previous step. The selected two numbers, 5 and 11, are added to obtain the new number 16. The remaining number, 40, is correctly included in the new set. This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it reduces the number of elements in the set and progresses towards the target. Step 3: This step is a logical inference of the previous step. The selected two numbers, 16 and 40, are subtracted to obtain the new number 24. Since there are no remaining numbers, the reasoning chain ends here.

The final result of 24 is mathematically correct and equal to 24 when evaluated.\nReasoning step 1: This step is a logical inference of the previous step as it follows the task rule of selecting two numbers (4 and 10) from the current set and performing the operation of multiplication to obtain a new number (40). The remaining numbers (5 and 11) are correctly updated, and the new set (40 5 11) is formed. This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it reduces the number of elements in the set.\nReasoning step 2: This step is a logical inference of the previous step as it follows the task rule of selecting two numbers (5 and 11) from the current set and performing the operation of multiplication to obtain a new number (16). The remaining number (40) is correctly updated, and the new set (16 40) is formed. This step is beneficial to the correct solution as it further reduces the number of elements in the set and follows the task rule of selecting two numbers (16 and 40) from the current set and performing the operation of multiplication to obtain a new number (24). Since there are no remaining numbers, the new set is formed with only the computed new number (24).
