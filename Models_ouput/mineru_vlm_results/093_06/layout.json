It is evident that, in general, the pixels are accurately classified into their respective classes. This observation highlights the challenge of detecting BMSB specimens against dark brown vegetal backgrounds using only RGB images, whereas the bugs are distinctly identified using SWIR- HSI. The prediction images of tree branches and soil as background reveal that spectral variable selection slightly enhances the classification of background pixels. To enhance BMSB detection capabilities for field applications, we integrated spectral information modeling with CNN algorithms to leverage spatial relationships among pixels. U- Net, in particular, is well suited for implementation on UAVs due to its ability to achieve satisfactory model performance with minimal computational resources [39]."

The camera consists of two distinct acquisition devices capturing in the ranges 457- 593 nm (16 bands) and 605- 845 nm (15 bands), respectively. For our experiments, we used the latter 15 bands of the images. In one approach (camera I, Fig. 3), we performed manual wavelength selection based on the visibility of BMSB to construct the false- color image. We identified the wavelengths 727.24, 811.24, and 608.75 as suitable for BMSB detection."

Sticky traps are widely used in orchards to attract and capture insects based on their color or pheromones. Agronomists can use these traps to estimate the insect populations by visiting their orchards regularly with manual trap inspection and insect counting. A preliminary version of the trap using mainly lab- based experiments and artificial insects to"
