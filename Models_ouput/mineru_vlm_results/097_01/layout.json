Different from the conventional coded- aperture imaging method, our method applies a sequence of coding patterns during a single exposure for an image frame. The parallax information, which is related to the differences in coding patterns, is recorded as events. The image frame and events, all of which are measured in a single exposure, are jointly used to computationally reconstruct a light field. We also designed an algorithm pipeline for our method that is end- to- end trainable on the basis of deep optics and compatible with real camera hardware. We experimentally showed that our method can achieve more accurate reconstruction than several other imaging methods with a single exposure. We also developed a hardware prototype with the potential to complete the measurement on the camera within 22 msec and demonstrated that light fields from real 3- D scenes can be obtained with convincing visual quality. Our software and supplementary video are available from our project website<sup>1</sup>."

As a solution for this issue, we propose a time- efficient light- field acquisition method that can complete the measurement in a single exposure. Our method combines a coded aperture [10, 14, 22, 30, 38] and an event- based camera [3, 9], as shown in Fig. 1, that can simultaneously capture image frames and events. Our method is based on the premise that the aperture coding can be controlled faster than the frame- rate of the image sensor.<sup>2</sup> We apply several coding patterns in sequence during a single exposure for an image frame. Therefore, we do not directly observe individual coded- aperture images, but we have the sum of them as a single image frame. The camera also measures the events asynchronously during the exposure. Since the target scene is assumed static, the events are caused exclusively by the change in coding patterns. In other words, we actively induce the events by changing the coding patterns over time. These events include the information related to the parallax among different viewpoints, which is essential for light- field/3- D reconstruction. The image frame and events, all of which are measured in a single exposure, are jointly used to computationally reconstruct the light field."
