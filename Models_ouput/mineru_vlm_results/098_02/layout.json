Then, we fine- tune the pretrained ICAE on instruction data for practical scenarios by enhancing its generated memory slots' interaction with various prompts.

                                    "content": "- We propose In-context Autoencoder (ICAE) \n- a novel approach to context compression by leveraging the power of an LLM. The ICAE either enables an LLM to express more information with the same context length or allows it to represent the same content with a shorter context, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle long contexts with improved latency and memory cost during inference. Its promising results and its scalability may suggest further research efforts in context management for an LLM, which is orthogonal to other long context modeling studies and can be combined with them to further improve the handling of long contexts in an LLM.- In addition to context compression, ICAE provides an access to probe how an LLM performs memorization. We observe that extensive self-supervised learning (e.g., autoencoding) in the pretraining phase is very helpful to enhance the ICAE's capability to encode the original context into compressed memory slots. This pretraining process may share some analogies with humans enhancing their memory capacity through extensive memory training, which improves the brain's memory encoding capabilities (Ericsson et al., 1980; Engle et al., 1999; Maguire et al., 2003). We also show that an LLM's memorization pattern is highly similar to humans (see Table 2 and Table 3). All these results imply a novel perspective on the connection between working memory in cognitive science (Baddeley, 1992) and representation learning in LLMs (i.e., context window)."
