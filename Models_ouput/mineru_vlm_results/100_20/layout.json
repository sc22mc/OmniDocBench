Evaluate Score: 0.7\nAnalysis Report: This reasoning chain cannot complete the task and reach the target correctly. The reasoning steps have errors that prevent the correct solution. Reasoning Step 1: This step is a logical inference of the previous step since it follows the rule of selecting two numbers, performing an operation, and updating the set accordingly. However, the reasoning step is not beneficial to the correct solution. The computed new number of 2 does not lead to the desired result of 24. Advice: Try different operations or combinations of numbers to obtain a new number that is closer to 24. Recommending or Reject description: Reject.\nReasoning Step 2: There is an error in the reasoning step description. It is mentioned twice as &quot;Reasoning Step 2&quot;. However, assuming it is a unique step, it is a logical inference of the previous step. The operation of multiplication (*) is applied correctly to the selected numbers, and the new number of 4 is obtained. The remaining numbers are updated accordingly. Recommending or Reject description: Recommend.\nReasoning Step 3: There is an error in the reasoning step description. It is mentioned as &quot;Reasoning Step 1&quot; instead of &quot;Reasoning Step 3&quot;. This step is not a logical inference of the previous step. The operation of multiplication (*) is applied to the same numbers as in Reasoning Step 1, but the computed new number of 1 is different. The remaining numbers are updated accordingly. Error Report: The computation in this step is incorrect. The correct computation should be 1 * 1 = 1.\nAdvice: Double-check the computation and make sure it is accurate. \nRecommendation or Reject description: Reject.\nConfidence score: 0.7\n####################################################################################################</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\">Five responses from the gpt-3.5-turbo</td></tr><tr><td>Step 1, Current set: 1 1 4 6, Selected two numbers: 1 4, Operation: *, Computed new number: 4, Remaining numbers: 1 6, New set: 1 4 6, \nStep 1, Current set: 1 1 4 6, Selected two numbers: 1 4, Operation: *, Computed new number: 1, Remaining numbers: 4 6, New set: 1 4 6, \nStep 1, Current set: 1 1 4 6, Selected two numbers: 1 4, Operation: *, Computed new number: 0.25, Remaining numbers: 1 6, New set: 0.25 1 6, \nStep 1, Current set: 1 1 4 6, Selected two numbers: 1 1, Operation: *, Computed new number: 0.25, Remaining numbers: 4 6, New set: 0 4 6, \nStep 1, Current set: 1 1 4 6, Selected two numbers: 1 1, Operation: *, Computed new number: 1, Remaining numbers: 4 6, New set: 1 4 6.
