However, after peeling the fruits, we observed that not all the exposed samples had been punctured, and that some control fruits presented damages. In addition, some damages found on exposed fruits were not due to BSBM but to other adversities (e.g., moulds). For these reasons, we used the RGB images of unpeeled and peeled samples to visually classify the fruits based on damage type and intensity. This labeling process allowed a better identification of the actual sound and punctured samples, and thus we only considered the images belonging to these two classes for further elaborations. Table V reports the number of images belonging to sound control pears and damaged fruits exposed to BMSB, subdivided by fruit variety and harvest year."

The identification of ROIs belonging to punctured areas is important to extract representative spectra to be used for the development of pixel- level classification models. To overcome this issue, we developed a supervised annotation method to automatically select pixels belonging to punctured areas. The proposed approach is based on data dimensionality reduction of the hyperspectral images using the common space hyperspectrograms (CSH) [51] followed by image- level classification, coupled with feature selection and visualization of the selected features back into the original image domain. More in detail, each image was converted into the corresponding CSH, a 1- D signal obtained by merging in sequence the frequency distribution curves of quantities obtained from a global PCA model2 (i.e., PC score vectors, Q residuals, and Hotelling T2 values)."

Fig. 8 shows a schematic representation of such a supervised annotation method."
