The conjoined field site, highlighted in red, is passed to Stage II. In Stage II, the algorithm removes pathways between fields and isolates their geometric boundaries. First, the conjoined site is plotted as a sampled image; the pathway pixels are then removed by applying a series of morphological image operations. The segmented fields are shown in the Result and Analysis, where the algorithm has successfully differentiated between this conjoined field use case. A field efficiency analysis of machinery performance is then shown in the histogram plot, where the colors correspond to the detected field boundaries.",

This is relevant at a time when the EU aims to halve pesticide use by 2030 under the farm-tofork strategy [21]. Proximal sensing applications on agricultural machinery [14], [22], [23] may play a role in satisfying PA data requirements [5], but the data must first be spatially classified.

The method is evaluated with geolocation and power take-off (PTO) digital event data obtained from a full harvesting season on machinery operated by a grass silage contractor. Contractors will often visit multiple adjacent fields in a single day, where they continue to activate the PTO, despite traversing into a new field. In the context of this article, a \"job site\" is a recorded work episode of the operating machinery performing a task in one or several fields of the same crop type. A work episode indicates that the machine is operating and that the PTO shaft is",
