However, the analysis at the initial iteration is vague, such as \"try other numbers and operations\". After five iterations, BoT aggregates multiple such analyses, deriving a more potent prompt, making the LLMs select the right numbers 9 and 7. Also, the advice is more concrete and useful. The advice for this right selection is to increase the corresponding evaluation score. Through the continuous accumulation such *experiences*, BoT progressively refines the prompt, culminating in the direct generation of a correct solution in the 8-th iteration.",

As compared to the Best-first that selects one from existing thought chains and no aggregation that maintains all thought chains, greedy aggregation adaptively merges tree structures into one better thought chain that may not exist in the current iteration. By doing so, LLM is able to perform a more meaningful analysis on a stronger thought chain, thus producing important experiences to enhance the prompt. As shown in Table 4, once the Greedy aggregation is used, BoT improves by more than  $2\\%$  in all cases. In AOuA, containing more math problems, this number is even  $10\\%$ . Besides, as our discussion in Fig. 4, ToT with a similar experience-driven boosting mechanism reaches  $80\\%$  but still lags behind the BoT.
