The results of total energy calculations for the A-type AFM configuration favor the out-of-plane over the in-plane magnetization by  $\\sim 0.4 \\,\\mathrm{meV}$  per Mn. Additional calculations indicate that the A-type AFM configuration has a lower energy than the FM configuration.

The latter case is more representative of  $\\text{MnBi}_{6}\\text{Te}_{10}$ , since it contains both SLs and QLs, and is discussed in detail below, while the former is presented in the Supporting Information (Sec. IIIA). Here, we emphasize one conclusion about  $\\text{MnBi}_{2}\\text{Te}_{4}$ : even though its defect-free form has the strongest AFM coupling between Mn in the consecutive SLs, based on our calculations, intermixing can induce the FM order between the SLs even in this compound (Fig. S5 in the Supporting Information). Hence, the emergence of strong out-of-plane FM correlations due to the intermixing is likely to be universally present in the  $MBT_n$  family, including  $\\text{MnBi}_6\\text{Te}_{10}$ .",
