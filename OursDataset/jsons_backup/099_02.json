      "text": "In this context, researchers have engaged in some explorations, with the central idea being to conceptualize evaluation as an instruction-following problem (Fu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) based on a high-capacity LLM. For example, Zheng et al. (2023); Zhou et al. (2023); Dubois et al. (2023) employ proprietary LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude or GPT-4) through API calls to perform various evaluation protocols. Such methods have shown decent agreement with human judgment, but they also face challenges in terms of consistency and reproducibility due to the opacity of API models as well as the high API cost. An alternative is to train a specialized evaluator based on open-source LLMs. PandaLM (Wang et al., 2023c) is able to compare a pair of responses for a given query with a brief explanation of the evaluation process, and Shepherd (Wang et al., 2023b) can provide critiques to a LLM's response to pinpoint its shortcomings. These models have achieved remarkable performance in certain settings; however, they are relatively limited in the following aspects: (a) Some are not optimized to evaluate various deployed LLMs under massive real-world scenarios but are only trained on synthetic data (e.g., the Alpaca dataset Taori et al. (2023) by GPT-3.5), online forums, or traditional NLP datasets, without the consideration of scenario-specific evaluation criteria. (b) Each of these models only supports one evaluation protocol, like pairwise comparison or single-response evaluation, making them less flexible for various evaluation requirements. (c) They only provide brief or no natural language explanation for their evaluation, reducing the reliability of the result.",

Methodologically, to train a more generalized judge, we created a new dataset from a large collection of data, encompassing 58 different scenarios, with most samples coming from real-world user queries and LLMs' responses. Based on the dataset, we guide GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) with carefully hand-written criteria for each scenario to collect desired evaluation judgments as our supervised training signals and apply heuristic filtering strategies and post-processing to unify output formats and mitigate noise. We also design new testbeds from the above dataset for pairwise comparison and single-response evaluation, with a diverse and balanced scenario distribution  $(\\S 5.1)$ . Through comprehensive meta-evaluation on its evaluation functionalities, we show that AUTO-J outperforms various strong baselines, including both open-source and closed-source models ( $\\S 6.1$ ,  $\\S 6.2$ ,  $\\S 6.3$ ). We also conduct detailed analysis and case studies (ยง6.4) to show a series of advantages offered by AUTO-J, from lessened positional bias in pairwise comparison, more specific critiques in single-response evaluation to the potential as a generative reward model to help improve base LLMs. To summarize, our contributions are:",
