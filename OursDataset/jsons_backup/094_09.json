The detection of leaf disease, as well as the collecting and labeling of a large number of disease photos, requires a huge amount of people, material resources, and financial resources. Some plant diseases have a shorter onset period and are more difficult to collect [9]. Furthermore, the storage and processing of datasets can be demanding. For instance, the use of high-resolution images and hyperspectral images involves the processing of a large amount of data. This poses some computational challenges. Hence, the need to employ parallel processing, batch processing, and hardware acceleration could solve these computational challenges and provide a real-time analysis as a viable solution.",
