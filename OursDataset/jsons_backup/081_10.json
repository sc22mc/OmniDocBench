In the absence of wave effects, the neutrino spectrum used here should preclude any r-processing whatsoever. The wind would undergo an alpha-rich freezeout, leaving only free protons to capture onto seed nuclei. However, with wave effects included, we find similar r-processing regimes to those obtained with neutrino energies tuned to  $Y_e = 0.48$ . In the wave stress regime, with  $5 \\times 10^{-4} \\le L_w/L_{\\nu} \\le 5 \\times 10^{-3}$ , the change in  $Y_e$  is not large enough to make the wind neutron rich, but the faster outflow caused by the wave stress prevents an  $\\alpha$ -rich freezeout from occurring. R-process elements are then synthesized from the free neutrons in the wind, despite the wind being overall proton-rich. This gives rise to the suppressed, actinide-free r-process patterns in figure 11. In between the r-processing regimes, we again find a region where the combined entropy and dynamical timescale in the wind favor strong seed formation and thus no r-processing, regardless of  $Y_e$  or the presence of an  $\\alpha$ -rich freezeout. At high  $L_w$ , the wind becomes neutron-rich again, and early wave heating suppresses seed formation and drives the same strong r-processing as in figure 7.",

For the highest neutrino and wave luminosities, shock heating begins early enough in the wind to drive a strong r-process. This shock heating regime is fairly insensitive to PNS mass but very dependent on wave frequency, which sets how early shock heating can begin in the wind. The second r-processing regime, driven by acceleration due to the wave stress, is strongly dependent on mass but insensitive to wave frequency. We see this regime emerge at a PNS mass of around  $1.8M_{\\odot}$ , and grow to dominate the parameter space for the most massive neutron stars. The",

The presence of shock heating in the wind precludes reliance upon the common predictive metric  $s^3/\\tau_d$ , as entropy is no longer nearly constant during seed formation.

      "text": " non-monotonic dependence of the average mass number of the final abundances is also visible here. At higher masses, the wave stress contribution is able to drive strong r-processes even for very low neutrino and wave luminosities, where shock heating begins too late to strongly affect the nucleosynthesis. We have also run similar calculations with  $Y_{e,eq} = 0.45$ . These show qualitatively similar behavior to the results shown in figure 12, except that the onset of wave stress-driven r-process nucleosynthesis is shifted to lower PNS mass.",
