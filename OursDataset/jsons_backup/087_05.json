      "text": " However, test cases shown in all previous works  $[34]$ ,  $[35]$ , [36], [37], [38] do not include conjoined field segmentation conditions as illustrated in Fig.  $2(a)$ , only road-to-field cases. Instances of isolated fields, connected by a road in between, may be solved using a Hall effect sensor for cases of towed implements. These sensors can be purchased for under â‚¬5 [50]. This is sufficient to detect when the PTO is active and the implement is mechanically powered, which indicates, along with implement motion, that the machine is interacting with the crop. The inverse is true when the PTO is inactive and the implement is in motion, which allows for the detection of road travel. Thus, a significant challenge in coordinate-based field segmentation remains in solving for conjoined, field-tofield cases when the operator moves between adjacent fields connected by short, off-road pathways. This is one of the key",

This is despite the fact that GPS is a proven, robust, and readily available technology. The review highlights how existing vehicular trajectory segmentation methods do not translate well to the field segmentation problem. Common trajectory segmentation policies either require a priori knowledge of machinery operator behavior and their driving patterns; geo-markers from third party sources; or rely on using established road networks. These concepts and methods do not crossover to an agricultural setting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, challenging conjoined field segmentation cases have not been addressed in the current literature. A cost-effective coordinate-based solution to automatically segment agricultural fields is required.",

Then, the proposed algorithm is presented in two stages. In Stage I, measurements are preprocessed to determine whether PTO activation has occurred and if road travel has taken place between activation periods, as described in Section III-B. In Stage II, pathways that may be present between adjacent fields in the sampled image are removed by applying a series of morphological image operations. The algorithm then detects the individual field boundaries from the processed image. Finally, the field boundaries are converted back to Cartesian and the machinery coordinate data are labeled as belonging to a particular field, with details given in Section III-C. The method is fully automated, deterministic, and segments all fields in a job site in one pass.",

The machinery was owned and operated by a machinery contractor based in Galway, Ireland, as detailed in [56]. For machinery coordinates, a NEO-M8 GNSS positioning receiver with a wideband GNSS antenna was fitted to the implements [57]. The acquisition frequency of the GNSS is 1 Hz. PTO speed was measured using an NPN digital hall-effect sensor [50] installed on the implement drivetrain sprocket with a protruding notch. Pulse counts were translated to frequency, which are represented as the PTO rotations per minute (rpm). Fuel usage measurements were obtained from the tractor J1939 interface. The data were stored locally in a document-based database operating on an 8th generation Intel Nuc (Intel i3 processor and 4 GB of RAM) running Ubuntu 16.",

This is despite the fact that GPS is a proven, robust, and readily available technology. The review highlights how existing vehicular trajectory segmentation methods do not translate well to the field segmentation problem. Common trajectory segmentation policies either require a priori knowledge of machinery operator behavior and their driving patterns; geo-markers from third party sources; or rely on using established road networks. These concepts and methods do not crossover to an agricultural setting. To the best of the authors' knowledge, challenging conjoined field segmentation cases have not been addressed in the current literature. A cost-effective coordinate-based solution to automatically segment agricultural fields is required.",
