In the  $\\text{AFM}_1$  and  $\\text{AFM}_2$  models, the Mn spins in the two consequent  $3a$  positions are oppositely coupled.

All but one models of the first two categories, where the intermixed  $\\text{Mn}$  cations occupy *either* the SLs  $or$  the QLs, show an AFM configuration as the lower energy state. This preference reverts markedly if the antisite Mn distributes over the  $6c$  positions of both the QLs and the SLs: five out of the seven constructed structure configurations of this category prefer the FM phase. A closer look reveals that the preference for the FM state is particularly prominent in those structure models ( $S_{12}$  to  $S_{15}$ ), in which the Mn cations occupy the nearby 6c positions not separated by the  $3a$  positions – namely, when continuous magnetic exchange pathways exist between the antisite Mn ions.",
