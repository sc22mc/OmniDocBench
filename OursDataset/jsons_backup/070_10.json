The total energy difference between the FM and A-type AFM configurations was computed using for Brillouin zone integrations a linear tetrahedron method. For  $\\text{MnBi}_{6}\\text{Te}_{10}$ , we use a mesh of the Brillouin zone having  $14 \\times 14 \\times 14$  subdivisions. The magnetic anisotropy energy was calculated in the AFM state based on a mesh having  $10 \\times 10 \\times 10$  subdivisions. The Mn  $3d$  occupancy and the spin projection presented in the main text correspond to the gross projections. For the calculations of  $\\text{MnBi}_{4}\\text{Te}_{7}$  based on a  $2 \\times 1 \\times 2$  supercell, we use a mesh with  $6 \\times 12 \\times 2$  subdivisions.",
