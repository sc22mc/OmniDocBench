In addition, they demonstrate several advantages of our reproduction steps, such as complete steps, region/text of interest, technical language, etc. Since the steps we generate are matched with each action one-to-one, participants can easily track each step, while the missing steps in the control group may confound participants: whether the step description corresponds to the current GUI.  $P_5$  also finds the absolute positioning and element relationship description particularly useful to him, because such description can narrow down the spatial regions in GUI and easily locate the GUI element in which a bug occurs.  $P_3$  reports that some users may use inconsistent words to describe the steps. For example, users may use \"play the film\" to describe the button with the text \"movie\", making the developers hard to reproduce in practice. In contrast, the descriptions we generate are entirely based on GUI content, so it is easy to find the GUI elements.",

We first gave them an introduction to our study and also a real example to try. Each participant was then asked to reproduce the same set of 10 randomly selected bug recordings from real-world issue reports in GitHub, on average, 3.6 TAP, 1.2 SCROLL, and 1.0 INPUT per recording. The experimental bug recordings can be seen in our online appendi $x^2$ . The study involved two groups of four participants: the control group  $P_1$ ,  $P_2, P_3, P_4$  who gets help with the reproduction steps written by reporters from GitHub, and the experimental group  $P_5$ ,  $P_6$ ,  $P_7$ ,  $P_8$  who gets help with the natural language description generated by our tool. Each pair of participants  $\\langle P_x, P_{x+4} \\rangle$ has comparable development experience, so the experimental group has similar capability to the control group in total. Note that we did not ask participants to finish half of the tasks with our tool while the other half without assisting tool to avoid potential tool bias. We recorded the time used to reproduce the bug recordings in Android. Participants had up to 10 minutes for each bug replay. To minimize the impact of stress, we gave a few minutes break between each bug replay. At the end of the tasks, we provided 5-point Likert-scale questions to collect their feedback, in terms of clearness, conciseness, and usefulness. We further collected participants' feedback through a few open-ended questions, which can help us bring more insight into our tool, including how could the subtitles be improved, are there any software engineering tasks that would benefit from subtitles, etc.",
