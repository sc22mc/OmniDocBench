The present study was performed on four individual Mn-deficient  $\\text{MnBi}_{6}\\text{Te}_{10}$  crystals (denoted as Sample #1 – #4 henceforward; for their chemical compositions (EDX) see Fig. S2). Powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements, which required grinding the crystals to a homogeneous powder, were conducted after all other measurements had been finalized, in order to elucidate the underlying intermixing phenomenon. We confirmed that all four samples exhibit the crystal lattice of  $\\text{MnBi}_{6}\\text{Te}_{10}$  with a sequence of one SL and two QLs (Fig. 1a) plus notable cation antisite disorder.  $\\text{MnBi}_{6}\\text{Te}_{10}$  constituted the main phase as per Rietveld method and we established a firm link between the Mn content as found by EDX and the underlying crystal lattice of  $\\text{MnBi}_{6}\\text{Te}_{10}$  in our samples.",
