      "text": " Abstract-Long-term focused attention with visualization and breathing exercises is at the core of various Eastern traditions. Neurocognitive and psychosomatic phenomena demonstrated during such exercises were instrumentally explored with EEG and other sensors. Neurocognitive modeling in the form of meditative visualization produced persistent temperature effects in the body long after the exercise finished; this raises the question about their psychosomatic or biophysical origin. The work explores this question by comparing experiments with focusing attention inside and outside the body. EEG, temperature, heart and breathing sensors monitor internal body conditions, high resolution differential calorimetric sensors are used to detect thermal effects outside the body. Experiments with 159 attempts (2427 operator-sensor sessions) were carried over five months, control measurements run in the same conditions in parallel to experimental series. Increase of body temperature up to moderate fever zone 38.5  $^{\\circ}$ C and intentional control of up and down trend of core temperature by 1.6  $^{\\circ}$ C are demonstrated. Persistent temperature variations last  $>60$  min. Experiments also demonstrated induced thermal fluctuations at  $10^{-3}$  °C level in external calorimetric systems with  $15\\ \\text{ml}$  of water for 60-90 min. Repeatability of these attempts is over 90%, statistical Chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests reject the null hypotheses about random character of outcomes. Thus, the obtained data confirm the persistent thermal effects reported in previous publications and indicate their biophysical dimension. To explain these results we refer to a new model in neuroscience that involves spin phenomena in biochemical and physical systems. These experiments demonstrate complex biophysical mechanisms of altered states of consciousness; their function in the body's neurohumoral regulation and non-classical brain functions is discussed.",

Such calorimeters are able to measure extremely small  $t$  changes as a symmetry breaking effect. A separate laboratory was prepared for measurements, three calorimetric setups served as control systems and three others used in experiments, all systems running in parallel. Additionally, the power supply, electromagnetic emissions, magnetic fields, air pressure and mechanical impacts are recorded by corresponding sensors.
