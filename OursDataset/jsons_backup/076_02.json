Since such properties may significantly influence the outcomes of concrete scenarios' execution, we define a more concrete type of scenario:  Instantiated scenarios are scenarios that are ready to be executed in a test setup and include everything that is determined prior to execution. For virtual test setups, the instantiated scenario includes the environment models and their configuration.

While the literature primarily considers the successive definition of functional, logical, and concrete scenarios, tests ultimately have to be instantiated in a test setup. Thus, we refer to the scenario that is executed as the instantiated scenario. During execution, evaluation data are generated, which usually include objects' trajectories and log data. Based on these, evaluation metrics are derived to enable automated assessment. Section II-A to II-C explain these artifacts and transitions in detail. To generate relevant concrete scenarios, current search-based techniques learn a mapping from concrete scenarios to the evaluation metrics, e.g., via regression or classification models (see Section II-D). To learn and predict across functional scenarios and evaluation metrics, we propose using motion prediction models that predict objects' trajectories based on scenario embeddings (see Section III).",
