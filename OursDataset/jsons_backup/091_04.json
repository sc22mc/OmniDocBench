The measurements are conducted over a wider frequency range of 10 Hz-1 MHz over 200 logarithmically spaced frequency points in the two-electrode configuration, in line with [22], [23]. According to the size of the nectarine sample (on average 66.7 mm), the distance between the plates is increased to 100.7 mm. To assess if the setup can distinguish the effect of mechanical damage on the nectarines a simple pendulum with a platform and a bob acting as a ball hammer was fabricated  $[24]$ ,  $[25]$ . The platform was constructed at the equilibrium position of the pendulum to hold the fruit sample. The bob was designed to replicate the bruising injury of fruit falling from a height of 30 cm, and it expresses its behavior as a partially elastic body Fig. S1 of the Supplementary Material. The weight of the bob was calculated according to the average weight of nectarines  $(152.25 \\text{ g})$ . It is important to note that the weight of the bob was negligible compared to the average weight of the fruit  $(3.72 \\text{ g})$ . The bob of the pendulum was let go at a height of 36 cm, mimicking the impact and bruising injury of a fruit falling. This collision is considered to be elastic which both kinetic energy and momentum are conserved. To calculate the impulse energy transferred from the pendulum to the sample, the changes in kinetic and potential energy before and after the collision need to be considered",

Such behavior can be explained by the fact that the mobility of polar molecules is increased at higher temperatures, which raises the dielectric constant of the measuring materials [\\[28\\]](#page-9-1). Compensation for the data based on temperature is needed to mitigate the effect of temperature on the samples.

The series capacitance decreases over time, indicating the aging of the sample. The decrease in series capacitance over time in the fruit can be attributed to factors, such as water content. During the ripening process of fruits, the water content gradually decreases, leading to an increase in impedance  $[29]$ . This decrease in water content is one of the factors contributing to the decrease in capacitance. However, it is important to note that the value of capacitance is not solely determined by water content but is primarily influenced by the degradation of the cell membrane. From an electrical perspective, the decrease in capacitance over time can be attributed to the degradation of the capacitive behavior of the cell membrane of the biological sample. This degradation allows for easier passage of current through the intra and extracellular space of fruit  $[30]$ .",
