In detail, we first collected 439 top-rated Android apps from Google Play covering 14 app categories (e.g., news, tools, finance, etc.). Each app was run for 10 minutes by Droidbot to automatically explore app functionalities by simulating user actions on the GUI. The simulated actions, including operation time, types, locations, etc, were dumped as metadata, representing the ground truth. Meanwhile, we captured a screen recording to record the actions for each app at 30 fps. As discussed in Section II-A, users may use different indicators to depict their touches. To make our recordings as similar to real-world recordings as possible, we adopted different touch indicators to record actions, including 181 default, 152 cursor, and 106 custom. In total, we obtained 439 10-min screen recordings as the experimental dataset for the evaluation.",

The performance of our method is much better than that of other baselines, i.e., 20%, 17% boost in video segmentation F1-score and accuracy compared with the best baseline (HIST). Although HIST achieves the best performance in the baselines, it does not perform well as it is sensitive to the pixel value. This is because the recordings can often have image noise due to fluctuations of color or luminance. The image similarity metrics based on structural level (i.e., SIFT, SURF) are not sensitive to image pixel, however, they are not robust to compare GUIs. This is because, unlike images of natural scenes, features in the GUIs may not distinct. For example, a GUI contains multiple identical checkboxes, and the duplicate features of checkboxes can significantly affect similarity computation. Besides, motionestimation baseline (EDGE) cannot work well in segmenting actions from GUI recordings, as GUI recordings are artificial artifacts with different rendering processes. In contrast, our method using SSIM achieves better performance as it takes similarity measurements in many aspects from spatial and pixel, which allows for a more robust comparison.",
