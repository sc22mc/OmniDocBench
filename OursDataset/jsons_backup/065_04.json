This line traces only one velocity component that is associated with the high-density material.

The brightest component is the one close to the velocity of the DCO<sup>+</sup> (3-2) line, and it hence arises from the high-density material. The fainter component of C<sup>18</sup>O (2-1) can appear on the red or blue side of the stronger component depending on the location in the cloud. In total, there are three different velocity components, the main one at 5.2 km/s (in all panels on all DCO<sup>+</sup> (3-2) spectra locations), a lower velocity component seen in the northwestern panels, and a higher velocity component seen in the southwestern panels. In the first two rows of Fig. 3 the faint component appears on the blue side, and in the two bottom rows of the spectrum grid it appears on the blue side of the stronger component.",

The uncertainty on the mass estimation with all these three errors is a total of 42%. With the 26% error on the velocity gradient, we get a final relative error of 49% for the value of the mass accretion rate. In addition, the inclination of the filament with respect to the plane of the sky is unknown, and it has an influence on the value of  $\\dot{M}_{\\text{acc}}$  by a factor of tan i (see, e.g., Chen et al. 2019).

These positions are shown with red plus signs in Fig. 4. We determine a conservative estimate of the length of the filament of 0.11 pc. This value is computed based on the H<sub>2</sub> column density from *Herschel* data, an area with a higher value than  $1.5 \\times 10^{22}$  cm<sup>-2</sup>. In this border we find almost all of the filament (second contour in Fig. 4). Thereby the velocity gradient is  $\\nabla V = \\Delta V/\\Delta R = 0.91 \\pm 0.23$  km s<sup>-1</sup> pc<sup>-1</sup>. To compute the mass of filament we employ this relation:",

This velocity pattern is consistent with core-forming motions (Hacar & Tafalla 2011). A small velocity gradient can be seen along the filament, which could be linked to the ongoing accretion material toward the central object.",
