When cation  $\\text{Mn/Bi}$  intermixing was allowed in the refinement, the reliability factors  $R_{all}$  and  $R_{obs}$  dropped down significantly, confirming that this phenomenon was undoubtedly present in the structure. Due to very low sample mass (1-2 mg), the acquired powder diffraction data did not allow us to settle in for just one particular intermixing model with a statistically unequivocal quantification. The refined Mn content is also strongly dependent on whether cation vacancies are allowed in the refinement. We opted for a structural solution without voids in the  $3a$  and  $6c$  positions. Despite the outlined uncertainties, all tested models with various composition constraints have in common that: 1) the Mn:Bi ratio in the  $3a$  position in the center of an SL is close to 56:44; 2) the outer cation site of an SL ( $6c$ ) contains up to 2 % Mn; 3) the QL always accommodates some Mn (2–7 % Mn) in the  $6c$  cation sites. The presence of Mn in all cation positions accords with our earlier reported refinement on  $\\text{Mn}_{0.81}\\text{Bi}_{6.13}\\text{Te}_{10}$  single crystals [\\[31\\]](#page-9-1) and is in contrast to the findings of Klimovskikh *et al.* [\\[23\\]](#page-9-1). Such subtle variations in intermixing patterns can dramatically impact the magnetic properties, as witnessed in the next subsection.",
