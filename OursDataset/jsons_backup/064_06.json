The results show that QR-CLIP can effectively utilize open-world knowledge to establish a closer connection between image and location information through fine-tuning CLIP.

We argue that this is because the mechanism of Example-F1: take the image of Fig. 1 as an example—the picture show many Arabia elements (turban and Arabic). It is not difficult for many models to recognize that this image was captured in the Middle East and to predict its hierarchical label as  $\\{`Asia'\\}$ . However, they failed when asked to predict the entire label {'Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Asia\"}. Therefore, the discrepancy in other metrics may be more noticeable.",

Comparing  $[CLS_i^*]$  and  $[CLS_i^\\prime]$  with the same number (*i.e.*,  $n = 2$ ) of [CLS], the latter has 7.15% and 0.86% higher location and time prediction accuracy (ID: 13,16,20,23). Besides, the performance of  $[CLS_i^*]$  is not significantly affected by the number of [CLS] (ID: 13-15,20-22). We argue that using MLP to aggregate the embeddings may destroy CLIP's original representation. It is better to separately calculate the similarities across each  $[CLS_i^\\prime]$  with the location and time labels and then select the one with the most significant value as the prediction. Then we analyze how different numbers of [CLS] affect the model performance. When  $n$  was increased to 8, no significant performance difference was observed, so we finally chose  $n = 6$  in the following experiments (ID: 17-19, 24-26).
