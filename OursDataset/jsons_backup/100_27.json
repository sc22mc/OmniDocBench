How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?\". The obtained reasoning chain is only halfway to the solution. This is generally caused by the LLMs used by BoT failing to understand the question correctly. Thus, even though BoT performs a correct reasoning process, the full reasoning chain toward the correct answers can not be obtained. Therefore, such a reasoning chain is still regarded as a success of BoT as it correctly solves the problem captured by the LLM.",

number of sheep in Charleston and Toulouse. According to the problem, Charleston<br>has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Therefore, Charleston has $4 * 20 = 80$ sheep..
