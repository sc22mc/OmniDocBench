They design architecture to allow the robot to navigate the greenhouse on its own, while the human partner operates the control panel to complete the necessary tasks. However, the architecture is only appropriate for use in a greenhouse and is not suitable for use in an open area. Adamides et al. [38] proposed a robot architecture for a semiautonomous agricultural teleoperated sprayer robot that focuses on human-robot interaction evaluation. The architecture, on the other hand, is not scalable to vast vineyards. Another VineRobot created by [39] is an agriculture mobile robot designed to roam the wine field autonomously and collect data to estimate vegetative production, water status, and grape composition, among other things. Emmi et al. [40] build a system architecture for both individual robots and fleets of robots that improves reliability, reduces complexity and costs, and allows applications from various developers to be integrated. Despite the fact that they recognized the need for agriculture robots to be smaller, more complex, and less expensive. Their architecture is anything but small, plain, or inexpensive.
