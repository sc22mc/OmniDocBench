However, it might struggles with scalability and modularity. Hence, as an alternative microservices architecture could be explore. Microservices architectures are known for their scalability. In a food processing scenario where different aspects (e.g., motion planning, object detection) might have varying computational demands, microservices can be individually scaled to meet specific requirements. Microservices allow for more independent modification of components. If there are changes in the food processing requirements for specific tasks (e.g., new products with different shapes), the relevant microservices can be updated without affecting the entire system. However, it may also brings complexity in terms of service communication, coordination, and potential challenges in maintaining consistency across services.",

      "text": " The food-packaging use-case addresses packaging of various food products, such as bags of chips. The task is to pick these products from a bin and place them in a variety of containers. The most suitable software architecture for a food packaging robot depends on various factors, including the specific requirements of the robot, the type of food being packaged, the production environment, and the available resources. However, some common architectural patterns that may be suitable for food packaging robots include client-server architecture, microservices architecture, and event-driven architecture. Even combining multiple architecture together could provide benefits, such as scalability, modularity, and flexibility, which can be crucial for ensuring the smooth and efficient operation of the robot in a complex production environment. In this study, we proposed event-driven architecture for packaging bags of chips by the robot, that allows for easy integration of new components, as well as efficient communication and coordination between subsystems, as shown in Fig. 3. Event-driven architecture is suitable for packaging bags of chips because it can handle a large number of events that occur during the packaging process. The software architecture can consists of the five high level modules having their specific tasks and responsibilities described as follows.",
