Denote by  $\\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  the Grassmannian formed by closed subspaces of  $H$  whose dimension and codimension both are infinite. We say that  $X, Y \\in \\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  are *ortho-*adjacent if they are compatible and  $X \\cap Y$  is a hyperplane in both  $X, Y$ , equivalently, the projections corresponding to  $X$  and  $Y$  commute and the rank of their difference is 2. A subset  $\\mathcal{C} \\subset \\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  is called a *connected component* if for any  $X, Y \\in \\mathcal{C}$  the intersection  $X \\cap Y$  is of the same finite codimension in both  $X, Y$  and  $\\mathcal{C}$  is maximal with respect to this property. Let  $f$  be a bijective transformation of  $\\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  preserving the ortho-adjacency relation in both directions. We show that the restriction of  $f$  to every connected component of  $\\mathcal{G}_{\\infty}(H)$  is induced by a unitary or anti-unitary operator or it is the composition of the orthocomplementary map and a map induced by a unitary or anti-unitary operator. Note that the restrictions of  $f$  to distinct components can be related to different operators.",

Any two adjacent subspaces are of the same dimension and codimension. Classic Chow's  $\\text{theorem}$  [2] characterizes semilinear automorphisms of vector spaces over division rings as adjacency preserving transformations of Grassmannians formed by finitedimensional subspaces. This result is a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry characterizing semilinear automorphisms as automorphisms of projective spaces. There are analogues of Chow's theorem for totally isotropic subspaces of sesquilinear forms, singular subspaces of quadratic forms and various types of matrix spaces  $[3, 16, 24]$ . An extension of Chow's theorem on Grassmannians consisting of subspaces with infinite dimension and codimension is an open problem. We refer to  $[17, Section 2.4]$  for an explanation why this problem is hard.",
