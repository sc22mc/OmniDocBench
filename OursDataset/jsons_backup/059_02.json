To this end, we propose the History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session opendomain dialogue systems, which can effectively leverage history conversations to conduct more engaging MSCs. HAHT maintains a long-term memory to store historical conversational contexts, which is updated when a new session is conducted. Based on the long-term memory and the context in the current session, relevant tokens in historical contexts are selected to adapt the current response.",

The history memory serves as a high-level representation of history conversations. Secondly, as history conversations usually can facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context, we design a history-aware context encoder. The context encoder encodes conversation context, considering both history conversations and the current conversation, by adopting the transformer attention over the history memory and current conversation context. Then, the context encoder also updates the history memory based on the current conversation context. Finally, we design a history-aware decoder to fuse learned history information into the response generation process. The history-aware decoder can switch between two strategies, i.e., generating a word from the generic vocabulary or directly copying a word from history conversations.",

Xu et al. released the first multi-session conversation dataset, *i.e.*, *Facebook* MULTI-SESSION CHAT (Facebook MSC), and explored different retrieval-augmented generative models on the dataset (Lewis et al., 2020; Shuster et al., 2021), which achieved better results than the standard Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).
