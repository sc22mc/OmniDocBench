This method is fast and stable. It typically guarantees competitive performance as the subsequent experience is able to be generated by analyzing the best chain among obtained reasoning chains. However, it can only select existing chains without making effective adjustments. Greedy aggregation is more advanced as it combines reasoning steps from different chains to produce a new, better reasoning chain with the highest edge weights. The greedy aggregation procedure in algorithm 16 contains two steps. It first collects reasoning steps that are similar to the aggregated reasoning step  $z_{i-1}$ . Thus, the next aggregated reasoning step is selected from the next reasoning steps of this collected set by maximizing the edge weights. And,  $sim$  is the similarity function that uses LLMs to assess the percentage of identical words and mathematical numbers shared between two paragraphs.  $0.7$  is an empirical threshold obtained from experiments.",
