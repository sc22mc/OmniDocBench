For Chi-square test the positive/negative results in experimental attempts are represented by  $'1''0'$  and we consider the null hypothesis about a random character of obtained data ( $50\\%$  of success under the experimental channel). The Mann-Whitney U test analyzes two groups of reactions from experimental and control attempts, where the null hypothesis is an identical distribution function of these groups. Results are shown in Table I; based on obtained values we reject the null hypotheses for Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests (significance level  $\\alpha = 0.005$ , two tailed).",

While heating or cooling of body regions during experiments are primarily generated by somatic factors (e.g. the blood circulation intensively impacts the heat distribution in the body), it is doubtful that prolonged continued heating or cooling in postexperimental period can also be explained by these factors. Experiments with external calorimetric measurements clearly demonstrate the same long-term sustained temperature variations where somatic factors are fully excluded.",

The spin conversion changes the equilibrium 3:1 rate of spin isomers and thus changes the heat capacity. This in turn results in a symmetry breaking dynamics of temperature in differential calorimeters. The spin conversion can be triggered by different weak interactions (with minimal energy about  $10^{-27}$ J), e.g. by long-range spin-spin interactions [39], [40] or environmental factors [41]. Taking into account recent publications on non-classical brain functions, in particular on entanglementmediated consciousness [28], as a hypothesis, it is assumed that such a spin conversion induced through ASC, can cause the observed thermal effects.",
