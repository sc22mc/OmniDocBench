FANETs have particular design and protocol constraints because of the mobility and restricted resources of UAVs. Service robots are being used more and more in agriculture. They work in both agriculture and animal husbandry. Chikurtev [\\[55\\]](#page-5-1) presented a distributed software architecture for controlling a modular service robot for animal husbandry. The purpose of this design was to allow interinstalled module communication. Services and microservices are the foundation for the requests and replies that are exchanged between the various components.",
