Unfortunately, many biomolecules contain metastable states separated by energy barriers that can take milliseconds of MD simulation time ( $\\sim 10^{12}$  sequential integration steps) to cross, rendering this approach infeasible. To overcome this, prior work has produced an array of enhanced sampling *methods*, such as coarse graining (Clementi, 2008; Kmiecik et al., 2016) and metadynamics (Laio & Parrinello, 2002).

      "text": " Furthermore, standard MD simulations do not transfer information between molecular systems: for each system studied, a new MD simulation must be peformed. This represents a wasted opportunity: many molecular systems exhibit closely related dynamics, and simulating one system should yield information relevant to similar systems. In particular, proteins, being comprised of linear sequences of 20 kinds of amino acids, are prime candidates to study this kind of transferability. We propose Timewarp, a general, transferable enhanced sampling method which uses a *normalising flow* (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) as a proposal distribution for a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method targeting the Boltzmann distribution. Our main contributions are:",
