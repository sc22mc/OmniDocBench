However, since we only have one reasoning step<br>provided, we cannot determine whether the chain can be completed successfully or not.<br>Reasoning step 1: The reasoning step is a logical inference of the previous step, as it follows the given task rule of selecting two numbers (5 and 2) from the current<br>set and performing the subtraction operation. The computed new number is 3, and the remaining numbers are 6 and 6. The new set becomes 3, 6, 6. This step is<br>beneficial to the correct solution as it reduces the number of elements in the set and provides a new number for further operations.<br>Advice: No errors or revisions are needed for
