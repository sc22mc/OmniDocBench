Example 1: Text: We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 \\texttt{exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic}benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformerbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4. Prompt: What is GPT4? Assistant A: GPT4 is a large-scale language-trained transformer-based model. Assistant B: GPT4 can produce outputs. ``` Your output should be: ``` {\"reason\": \"The instruction asks what GPT4 is, and from the original text, we know that GPT4 is a multimodal, large-scale model that can generate text. Therefore, Assistant A is the closer answer, while Assistant B did not follow the instruction well in providing a response.\", \"choice\": \"A\"} ```  Example 2: ``` Text: Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can  generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to  the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users.",
