In this work, the time-reversal (TR) concept is used to shape the phase distribution of the phased array elements for the NFF of the electromagnetic field strength. It is shown that the TR concept is equivalent to the known ray optic method for the NFF. A slotted waveguide phased array antenna operating at 5.8 GHz is designed to provide the maximum electric field strength at the near-field region of the phased array. It is shown that the application of the full-wave simulation allows for an antenna design that provide high strength of the electromagnetic field and sufficient steerability even at near-field conditions close to the phased array antenna.",

      "text": " To determine the phase distribution of the phased array antennas' elements for the NFF, a ray optic concept is proposed that correctly considers the phase difference between the far-field (FF) region and the near-field (NF) region. The idea comes from the point that in the NF region, the distance between two adjacent elements significantly affects the phase value and should be correctly considered. The details of the method are described in  $[4]$ .",
