      "text": " Scalable lossless video coding and a high visual quality of the corresponding BL is very important for many professional applications. Wavelet-based video coding provides full scalability without additional overhead. The temporal resolution can be controlled by the recursive application of the WT in temporal direction to the LP subband of the previous stage. This leads to lower bit rates, but if the content of the underlying video sequence comprises strong motion, the visual quality of the BL is degraded significantly. We proposed a method which locally adapts the temporal scaling by evaluating a Lagrangian cost functional in every transformation step and prevents further decomposition, if the costs of the current level are higher than the costs of the previous level. This way, we can increase the visual quality of the BL by  $10.28 \\text{ dB}$  compared to the U-WL with blockbased MC, while the required rate is reduced by  $1.06\\%$  at the same time. Further work aims at the development of an algorithm to determine the optimum value of  $\\lambda$  in a rate-distortion sense, based on the characteristics of the underlying sequence.",
