Despite achieving partic ularly notable metrics scores in the ONLY set, the model has  depicted the least robustness against background-only patches,  namely, in the ALL set. So, YOLOV5-X was prone to recognize   $\\geq 55\\%$  of BMSB instances with a particularly promising pre cision when a BMSB appears inside the frame. However, this  latter capability deteriorates dramatically  $(P = 53.5\\%)$  when  images without BMSB are considered. It is noteworthy that each  network tends to achieve a larger  $P$  than  $R$ . This phenomenon is  strictly related to the poses experienced during the acquisition,  compounded by the noise surrounding the BMSB pixels, such as  blur or overexposure. Despite the dataset comprising a diverse  range of BMSB samples, certain poses and lighting/blurriness  conditions are more frequent than others. Also, since the dataset  consists of images captured by a drone operating according to an  autonomous protocol, characterizing the entire range of possi bilities is extremely challenging. As a result, the networks were  able to detect BMSB instances that presented limited variation  in pose and color appearance, thereby minimizing FP. How- ever, instances significantly affected by noise were occasionally  missed. Both YOLOv9 and YOLOv10-X achieve interesting  performance representing a true step ahead of the predeces sor, YOLOv5. Although YOLOv10-X obtained the largest  $R$ ,  YOLOv9-T achieves the best performance overall. Specifically,  it reaches a satisfactorily  $R \\approx 60\\%$  and almost the largest P  with both the thresholds,  $95.0\\%$  and  $94.0\\%$ , respectively.",

On the other hand, the NNs have developed limited abilities in contouring the BMSB according to mAP<sup>0.95</sup><sub>0.5</sub> because they are less robust when the IoU increases. In other words, the ma- jority of predictions overlap partially with the ground truth. This represents a predictable outcome due to the limited size of the BMSB with respect to the entire image. For monitor- ing purposes, recognizing all instances inside the frame, i.e., achieving high recall, is more important than accurately con- touring a bug, i.e., achieving high IoU. However, it noteworthy that both YOLOV9 and YOLOv10 demonstrate improved IoU values between prediction and ground truth, suggesting a clear enhancement with previous releases. Moreover, in comparison with the results in [\\[20\\]](#page-9-1) where entire images are simply resized and fed to the model, the current implementation of the slicing mechanism allows a boost in the performance, specifically in the recall. Indeed, image slicing prevents information losses since it retains every pixel of the original image.",

Then, we divided the images into training and test sets for model development and validation, respectively. Our classification approach focused on modeling the spectral information contained in the HSI images and identifying the relevant spectral regions to discriminate BMSB from vegetal backgrounds. To do this, we used the soft partial least squaresdiscriminant analysis (Soft PLS-DA) algorithm, coupled with sparse-based methods for spectral variable selection (s-Soft PLS-DA) [38].
