The overview of our methods is shown in Fig. 5. The prediction of *TAP* location requires a semantic understanding of the GUI transition captured in the clip, such as touch indicators (in Section II-A), transition animation, GUI semantic relation, etc. Therefore, we propose a deep-learning-based method that models the spatial and temporal features across frames to infer the  $TAP$  location. To infer the moving offset of SCROLL, we adopt an offthe-shelf image-processing method to detect the continuous motion trajectory of GUIs, thus, measuring the user's scrolling direction and distance. To infer the input text of INPUT, we leverage the OCR technique to identify the text difference between the frames of keyboard opening (i.e., where the user starts entering text) and keyboard closing (i.e., where the user ends entering).",

The output of the fully connected layer is 2 neurons, representing  $(x, y)$  coordinates. To accelerate the training process [31], we standardize the coordinate relative to the width and height of the frame. Although the frames are densely recorded (i.e. 30fps), the GUI renders slowly. To extract discriminative features from the recording, we uniformly sample 16 frames at 5 frame intervals  $(T = 16)$ as suggested in [28]. Note that if the length of the recording clip is smaller than the sample rate  $16 \\times 5$ , we will sample the frames based on nearest neighbor interpolation. To make our training more stable, we adopt Adam as the optimizer [32] and MSELoss as the loss function [33]. Moreover, to optimize the model, we apply an adaptive learning scheduler, with an initial rate of 0.01 and decay to half after 10 iterations. The hyperparameter settings are determined empirically by a small-scale experiment.",
