During the feature extraction process, new plant disease feature vectors are formed, which combine the spatial and spectral features and then feed into classification-based models. In some instances, vegetation indices can be considered the features to feed onto the models  $[17]$ . Vegetation indices are obtained by combining spectral features of multispectral satellite images at the VNIR range of the green plants [223]. However, for hyperspectral images, vegetation indices are defined at the plants' medium and NIR bands to detect the diseases. The vegetation indices simplify the processing of the hyperspectral images as they focus on particular bands where the conditions or changes are observed. This helps to reduce the processing cost of hyperspectral images as well [176].",

Therefore, a combination of other techniques such as PCA, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and minimum noise fraction techniques  $(MNF)$  [17] can be used to improve the feature extraction process. PCA can capture the important features in the spectral data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The LDA can then be employed to improve the separability of the diseased and healthy datasets in the feature space. MNF can help to discard the redundant noisy spectral information and focus on the important spectral band information.

For instance, regression or classification models can be employed for plant disease diagnosis/detection. Regression models aim to predict the targeted variable (such as disease), and the classification models aim to distinguish target variables [17]. Generally, two types of models are used to perform the hyperspectral images: 1) machinelearning-based classification models, which include neural network [254], SVM [158], random forest (RF) [255], k-nearest neighbor (kNN) [256], spectral angle mapper (SAM) [257], and maximum likelihood algorithms [258]; and 2) regressionbased models, which include partial least squares regression (PLSR) [259], Dirichlet aggregation regression [7], logistic regression [260], and multiple linear regression [261]. Neural networks are machine-learning-based algorithms consisting of interconnected nodes that learn the pattern and perform the prediction. The neural network is trained on the labeled images/data of the plants. Once the training is completed, the neural network can be used for predicting the health condition of the plants in the new datasets or unlabeled datasets  $[3]$ ,  $[262]$ . SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that helps to find the best hyperplane that separates data points of different classes. For plant disease detection, it can be used to differentiate between healthy and diseased plant samples based on their",
