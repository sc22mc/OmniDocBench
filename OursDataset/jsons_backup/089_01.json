However, the alarming rise in honeybee mortality, attributed to various stress factors including climate change, has highlighted the urgency of implementing effective monitoring strategies. Remote sensing of beehives emerges as a promising solution, with a focus on understanding and mitigating the impacts of these stressors. Differently from other approaches proposed in the literature, this study specifically explores the potential of lightweight machine learning models and the extraction of compressed feature to enable future deployment on microcontroller devices. The experimentation involves the application of support vector machines and neural network classifiers, considering the influence of variable audio chunk durations, the utilization of different hyperparameters and combining the audio recorded in several hives and available in different datasets.",

      "text": " The Internet of Things (IoTs) systems can be a viable solution, they are networks of interconnected devices that communicate and share data over the internet. In the context of audio signal collection, IoT technologies enable the deployment of smart sensor systems. These include wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that allows to cover wide areas, smart microphones for local audio processing, edge computing for latency reduction, cloud integration for data storage and analysis, and machine learning that enables advanced audio analytics. Together, these technologies enhance efficiency and enable various applications, such as remote monitoring and surveillance. Concerning the energy usage and the implications of deploying these systems within a beehive, it is crucial to deploy a device that does not introduce stressors to the hive's natural conditions and does not demand frequent human intervention, such as battery replacements. While certain studies investigate embedded systems with long range communication protocols, some of these approaches may demand considerable computational power and could necessitate modifications to the beehive [8], [13], [14], [19]. This renders them impractical for real-world applications. Recent studies highlight sound analysis as a promising and noninvasive",

      "text": " Most of the proposed approaches are equipped with multiple sensors to collect hive parameters, such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, and weight [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], but also methods that adopt computer vision for tracking bees at hive entrances demonstrate a good alternative for bee activity monitoring [13], [14]. However, the sound analysis alone has proven to be very effective in detecting various hive events, such as swarming  $[15]$ ,  $[16]$  or the presence and absence of a queen  $[17]$ . The presence of the queen bee is a fundamental condition for the survival of the hive  $[18]$ , the queen is the only fertile female, in the event she dies, the hive would not have any chance of survival. It is important to identify as soon as possible the absence of the queen bee and inform the beekeeper about this event, then he can act to add another queen bee into the hive.",
