This may take considerable resources. To overcome the cost of using ML and DL, the use of transfer learning is now being employed. This involves the use of pretrained models on a large dataset for new datasets. Some of the pretrained models include AlexNet, VGG, and GoogleNet.

They are less accessible to small-scale farmers and regions with limited resources, and their accuracy depends on high-quality samples and stringent protocols. Moreover, they employ destructive sampling and cannot distinguish between viable and dead DNA, which will likely result in some false positives. In contrast, image processing is more cost-effective, noninvasive, nondestructive, and suitable for real-time field monitoring, making it accessible and practical for small-scale farmers. However, it may not match the accuracy and specificity of molecular methods, especially for early stage or visually indistinct diseases, and can be influenced by environmental factors. Combining both methods can provide a comprehensive solution for effective disease management in ginger.",

Unlike the use of only ML techniques that rely on the use of historical datasets for disease detection, the application of AIoT can enable proactive monitoring based on environmental conditions. Early warning systems can be implemented to generate alerts or notifications when conditions conducive to the development of ginger diseases are detected. This involves the development of predictive models that leverage historical data on ginger diseases, environmental conditions, and crop management practices to forecast disease outbreaks with real-time data.
