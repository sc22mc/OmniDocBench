We fixed the following three parameters: the constant value, the iron abundance  $A_{\\text{Fe}}$ , and the ionization parameter  $\\log \\xi$  to the same as the average energy spectrum. We set 20 walkers with the prior parameters from the average energy spectrum fitting result in subsection 2.2. We used a Gaussian prior with a center as the best-fitting value from the parameters of the averaged energy spectrum and a width as 20%. We set 5,000 walkers and 5,000 burn-in steps. The median value of the posterior samples is taken as the best-fitting value for each free parameter. The 68% interval of reduced chi-square extracted from the median value of posterior chi-squares is 0.93 to 1.1, which indicates that all the 5s energy spectra are well-fitted by the model.",

We also used the same spectral model that was used to fit the average energy spectrum to fit the stacked energy spectra. We fixed the constant value, the iron abundance  $A_{\\text{Fe}}$  and the ionization parameter  $\\log \\xi$  in the model at the same values obtained in the spectral fit of the average energy spectrum. The best-fitting spectral parameters corresponding to the peak and the trough phases are listed in Table 1. The best-fitting spectral parameters corresponding to the peak and trough phases agree with each other, except for the normalization  $norm$ , the reflection fraction  $\\mathcal{R}$ . The *norm* and  $\\mathcal{R}$  of the peak and trough phases are different by at least 97% and 70% significance levels, which is consistent with the statistical results of the 5-seconds spectra.",

      "text": "We plotted the unfolded energy spectra of peak/trough phases in the top panel of Figure 4. The best-fitting models of the Compton and reflection components are also added in the Figure 4. The spectral shape of the Compton components are almost the same at the peak and the trough phases, since only norm changes and other parameters related to Compton (such as  $kT_e$  and  $\\tau$ ) remain nearly constant. On the other hand, the spectral shape of the reflection component at the peak phase is different from that at the trough phase, since the reflection fraction  $\\mathcal{R}$  is larger. The reflection component dominates over the Compton below ~30 keV, and the Compton component becomes dominated above ~70 keV in both peak and trough phases.  The fractional photon flux change in the Compton component between peak and trough phases  $(C_{P}-C_{T})$  is almost the same for different energies since the normalization is the only parameter that",

      "text": "The most significant difference between the energy spectra corresponding to the peak and trough phases is the normalization (see Figure 3). The normalization determines the photon flux of both Compton and reflection components by the same factor. The reflection fraction  $\\mathcal R$  also varies between peak and trough phases. The photon flux of the reflection component is determined by  $norm \\times \\mathcal{R}$ (Niedzwiecki et al. 2019). So the variation of  $\\mathcal{R}$  makes the flux variability of the reflection component different from that of the Compton component. The normalization and reflection fraction are also found to significantly vary with the QPO phase in another BHXRB  $H1743-322$ , in which the normalization is also the parameter that bears the most significant change (Ingram et al. 2017). There is also difference in the inner disk temperature  $T_{\\rm in}$  between that of the peak and of the trough. Since the disk component was very weak in the observation and the inner disk temperature is tied to the seed photon temperature for Compotonization in the model we applied, we can not distinguish whether the variation in  $T_{\\rm in}$  was due to intrinsic disk variability or potential variation in the Compton component.",
