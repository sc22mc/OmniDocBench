      "text": " respond quickly to change, MFCs have *slow dynamics* because of the redox reactions and the evolution of the biofilm. When PMFC operating conditions vary, transients must be settled before we can draw conclusions on steady-state characteristics, such as maximum power point (MPP). For example, many commonly used dc–dc converters integrate FOCV MPPT algorithms by periodically detaching the load for some milliseconds to measure the OCV, and then modulating the cell voltage to a preset fraction of that OCV value [26]. While this trivial OCV measurement works very well for fast energy sources, such as photovoltaic cells, PMFCs require tens of minutes to reach OCV after unloading. If this is not accounted for when coupling PM-FCs to commercial dc-dcs, it leads to incorrect OCV sampling, which sets the working point far from the actual MPP. To adapt common dc-dcs to the slow dynamics characterizing PMFCs, Alaraj et al. [27] developed an MFC-specific MPPT algorithm, which includes waiting a correct amount of time where the cell is unloaded to capture steady-state OCV. Similarly, in this article, we capture the steady-state OCV after a sufficient unloading time of the PMFC—which we term *cell rest*—and externally apply a fraction of the measured OCV as MPP reference to the dc-dc. This operation is executed through a simple sample-and-hold circuit, which is briefly powered after cell unloading periods to obtain a new MPP reference (see Section III-C2). The benefits of this method can be appreciated in Fig. 4. We do not rely on the OCV fraction found from the polarization curve (MPP at  $30\\%$ ) but choose the OCV percentage that experimentally resulted in the fastest capacitor charging through the BQ25505, which we found to be  $50\\%$  (see Fig. 5). The downside of unloading a cell for some time to measure OCV correctly is that we cannot extract power from that cell during its rest period. If this can initially be seen as a limitation of our method, allowing cells to rest actually benefits the longevity of PMFCs, as continuous current drainage was proven to reduce PMFC performance in the long run [13], [14], [20], [28]. Besides, if multiple PMFCs are available, one can switch between cells to ensure continuous power extraction and cell rest, as shown in Reyes et al.'s [28] work.",

The development of cell impedance models can come in handy for MPPT, optimizing cell lifetime, and using the cell as a plant health biosensor. Cells are highly complex systems: although a favorite in literature has been the Randles cell, there is a lack of agreed-upon cell mathematical models. PMFC models can be obtained and used in different ways. For instance, Ma et al. [29] used a data-driven approach for modeling the relationship between temperature, pH, and OCV during startup. As mentioned, literature has often relied on EIS measurements to develop physical-based cell models [11].",
