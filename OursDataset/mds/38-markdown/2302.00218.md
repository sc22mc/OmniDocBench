ABSTRACT. We study the projection constant  $\lambda(\mathcal{S}_1(n))$  of the trace class  $\mathcal{S}_1(n)$  of all operators on the *n*-dimensional complex Hilbert space, and prove the integral formula  $\lambda(\mathcal{S}_1(n)) = n \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |\text{tr}(U)| dU$ , where the integration is with respect to the Haar measure on the group  $\mathscr{U}_n$  of unitary operators. The approach we use is based on harmonic polynomials on the unitary group. Using probabilistic methods, we show that  $\lambda(\mathcal{S}_1(n))/n \to \sqrt{\pi}/2$  as  $n \to \infty$ .

# INTRODUCTION

The projection constant is a fundamental concept in Banach spaces and their local theory. It has its origins in the study of complemented subspaces of Banach spaces. If  $X$  is a complemented subspace of a Banach space  $Y$ , then the relative projection constant of  $X$  in  $Y$  is defined by

$$
\begin{aligned} \boldsymbol{\lambda}(X,Y) &= \inf \big\{ \|P\| : \ P \in L(Y,X), \ P|_{X} = Id_{X} \big\} \\ &

= \inf \big\{ c > 0 : \ \forall \ T \in \mathcal{L}(X,Z) \quad \exists \ \text{ an extension } \ \widetilde{T} \in \mathcal{L}(Y,Z) \ \text{ with } \| \widetilde{T} \| \le c \, \|T\| \big\}, \end{aligned}
$$

where  $Id_X$  denotes the identity operator on X. The (absolute) projection constant of X is given by

$$
\boldsymbol{\lambda}(X) := \sup \ \boldsymbol{\lambda}(I(X), Y),
$$

where the supremum is taken over all Banach spaces *Y* and isometric embeddings  $I: X \to Y$ . It is well-known that any Banach space *X* embeds isometrically into  $\ell_{\infty}(S)$ , where *S* is a nonempty set depending on  $X$ , and then

(1)

$$
\lambda(X) = \lambda(Z, \ell_{\infty}(S)).
$$

Thus finding  $\lambda(X)$  is equivalent to finding the norm of a minimal projection from  $\ell_{\infty}(S)$  onto an isometric copy of *X* in  $\ell_{\infty}(S)$ .

Let us recall a few concrete cases relevant for our purposes - for an extensive treatment on all of this we refer to the excellent monograph [\[20\]](#page-2-1) of Tomczak-Jaegermann. We note that, all over the article, all Banach spaces are supposed to be complex.

A well-known simple application of the Hahn-Banach theorem shows that

$$
\lambda(\ell_{\infty}^{n})=1.
$$

The exact values of  $\lambda(\ell_2^n)$  and  $\lambda(\ell_1^n)$  were computed by Grünbaum [\[7\]](#page-7-1) and Rutovitz [\[19\]](#page-7-1): If  $d\sigma$  stands for the normalized surface measure on the sphere  $\mathbb{S}_n(\mathbb{C})$ , then

(2)

$$
\lambda(\ell_2^n) = n \int_{\mathbb{S}_n} |x_1| \, d\sigma = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \frac{n!}{\Gamma(n + \frac{1}{2})}
$$

On the other hand, if  $dz$  denotes the normalized Lebesgue measure on the distinguished boundary  $\mathbb{T}^n$  in  $\mathbb{C}^n$  and  $J_0$  is the zero Bessel function defined by  $J_0(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{\infty} \cos(t \cos \varphi) d\varphi$ , then

(3) 

$$
\boldsymbol{\lambda}(\ell_1^n) = \int_{\mathbb{T}^n} \Big| \sum_{k=1}^n z_k \Big| \, dz = \int_0^\infty \frac{1 - J_0(t)^n}{t^2} dt \, .
$$

Moreover, König, Schütt and Tomczak-Jagermann [\[13\]](#page-13-1) proved that for  $1 \le p \le 2$ 

(4) 

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\lambda(\ell_p^n)}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

Let us turn to the non-commutative analogs of these results. The operator analog of  $\ell_{\infty}^n$  is the Banach space  $\mathscr{L}(\ell_2^n)$ , the space of (bounded, linear) operators on  $\ell_2^n$  with the usual operator norm. By [\[6, Theorem 5.6\]](#page-6-1) it is known that

$$
\lambda\big(\mathscr{L}(\ell_2^n)\big) = \frac{\pi}{4}n
$$

The space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators  $\mathcal{H}_2(n)$  on  $\ell_2^n$  is a Hilbert space, and we may deduce from (2) that

$$
\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathscr{H}_2(n)\big) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{4} \frac{\Gamma(n^2+1)}{\Gamma(n^2+\frac{1}{2})}
$$

which in particular leads to the two limits

(5) 

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\boldsymbol{\lambda}(\mathscr{H}_2(n))}{n} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\boldsymbol{\lambda}(\mathscr{L}(\ell_2^n))}{n} = \frac{\pi}{4}.
$$

Finite dimensional Schatten classes form the building blocks of a variety of natural objects in non-commutative functional analysis. Recall that the singular numbers  $(s_k(u))_{k=1}^n$  of  $u \in \mathcal{L}(\ell_2^n)$  are given by the eigenvalues of  $|u| = (u^*u)^{1/2}$ , and that the Schatten *p*-class  $\mathscr{S}_p(n)$ ,  $1 \le p \le \infty$  by definition is the Banach space of all operators on  $\ell_2^n$  endowed with the norm  $||u||_p = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n |s_k(u)|^p\right)^{1/p}$  (for  $p = \infty$  we here take the maximum over all  $1 \le k \le n$ ). It is well-known that the equalities  $\mathscr{S}_{\infty}(n) = \mathcal{L}(\ell_2^n)$  and  $\mathscr{S}_2(n) = \mathcal{H}(\ell_2^n)$  hold isometrically. We remark that the space  $\mathscr{S}_1(n)$  is usually referred to as trace class.

For the non-commutative analogue of (3) in case of  $\mathcal{S}_1(n)$ , the best known estimate seems

(6)

$$
\frac{n}{3} \le \lambda \big(\mathscr{S}_1(n)\big) \le n
$$

The lower bound was proved by Gordon and Lewis in [\[6\]](#page-6-1), while the upper bound is a consequence of the famous Kadets-Snobar inequality [\[12\]](#page-6-1).

As pointed out in (3) there is a useful integral formula for  $\\\lambda(\ell_1^n)$ . Our main aim is to show a non-commutative analogue for  $\\lambda(\mathscr{S}_1(n))$ , and to employ it to get the missing limit from (5). More precisely, we prove that

$$
\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathscr{S}_1(n)\big)=n\int_{\mathscr{U}_n}|\mathrm{tr}(U)|\,dU,
$$

where the integration is with respect to the Haar probability measure on the unitary group  $\mathscr{U}_n$ , and then we apply a probabilistic approach (within the so-called Weingarten calculus) to derive

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathscr{S}_1(n)\big)}{n}=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}.
$$

We finish this introduction with a few words on the technique used. An important tool to calculate projection constants, and more generally to obtain minimal projections, is due to Rudin [\[17\]](#page-17-0) (see also [21, Chapter III.B]). This technique is sometimes called Rudin's averaging technique, and it for example may be used to prove  $(2)$  as well as  $(3)$ .

Given an isometric subspace  $X$  of  $Y$ , we sketch the most important steps of this strategy to find the relative projection constant  $\lambda(X, Y)$ : Select a possible 'natural candidate' **P** :  $Y \to X$  for a minimal projection; Find a topological group  $G$  acting on  $\mathcal{L}(Y)$ , that is, every  $g \in G$  defines operators  $T_g$  which acts in a 'compatible way' on  $Y$ ; Show that **P** in fact is the unique projection, which commutes with all operators  $T_g$ ,  $g \in G$ ; Consider an arbitrary projection **Q** :  $Y \to X$ , and average all operators  $T_g^{-1}$ **Q** $T_g$  with respect to the Haar measure on  $G$ . Then this average commutes with all operators  $T_g$ ,  $g \in G$ , and so it must coincide with **P**; Use a simple convexity argument to show that  $\lambda(X, Y) =$  ||**P**:  $Y \to X$ ||; Analyze ||**P** :  $Y \to X$ ||, in order to refine the formula for  $\lambda(X, Y)$ .

Thus, if here  $Y = \ell_{\infty}(S)$ , then (1) shows that these steps may lead to a formula/estimate of  $\lambda(X)$ . Let us see, how our object of desire  $\mathscr{S}_1(n)$  naturally embeds in some reasonable  $\ell_{\infty}(S)$ . It is well-known that  $\mathcal{L}(\ell_2^n)$  and  $\mathscr{S}_1(n)$  are in trace duality, that is, the mapping

(7) 

$$
\mathscr{S}_1(n) \to \mathscr{L}(\ell_2^n)^*, \quad u \mapsto [v \mapsto \text{tr}(uv)]
$$

defines a linear and isometric bijection. To go one step further, we may compose this mapping with the restriction map  $\mathscr{L}(\ell_2^n)^* \to C(\mathscr{U}_n)$ ,  $u \mapsto u|_{\mathscr{U}_n}$ , where  $\mathscr{U}_n$  stands for the group of all unitary  $n \times n$ matrices, and in fact this leads to an isometric embedding  $\mathcal{S}_1(n) \hookrightarrow C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  (see Proposition 2.11). So our aim in the following will be to analyze the relative projection constant  $\lambda(\mathscr{S}_1(n), C(\mathscr{U}_n)).$

In order to apply Rudin's avaraging technique we need to develop what we call 'unitary harmonics' on the unitary group  $\mathcal{U}_n$ , which (roughly spoken) are harmonic polynomials in finitely many 'matrix variables' *z* and  $\overline{z}$  from the unitary group  $\mathcal{U}_n$ . All this is deeply inspired by the classical theory of spherical harmonics (see, e.g., [\[18\]](#page-9-1)), that is, the study of harmonic polynomials in finitely many complex variables *z* and  $\overline{z}$  on the *n*-dimensional euclidean sphere  $\mathbb{S}_n$ . Unitary harmonics and their density in  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  are described in Section 1.

In Section 2 we formulate and prove our main Theorem 2.1. And although this is the sole focus of this work - structuring the proof of Theorem 2.1 carefully, shows that parts of it extend to a more abstract version given in Theorem 2.6.

# 1. Unitary Harmonics and Their Density

Recall that a polynomial  $f: \mathbb{S}_n \to \mathbb{C}$  on the *n*-dimensional euclidean sphere  $\mathbb{S}_n$  of the form

$$
f(z) = \sum_{\alpha \in J} c_{\alpha}(f) z^{\alpha} \overline{z}^{\beta},
$$

where  $J \subset \mathbb{N}_0^n$  is any finite index set, is called a spherical harmonic, whenever  $\Delta f = 0$ . We need to extend a few aspects of the theory of spherical harmonics on the sphere  $\mathbb{S}_n$  (as developed for example in [\[18, Chapter 12\]](#page-9-1), see also [\[4\]](#page-9-1)) to what we call unitary harmonics on the unitary group  $\mathcal{U}_n$ .

1.1. **Unitaries.** The group  $\mathscr{U}_n$  of all unitary  $n \times n$  matrices  $U = (u_{ij})_{1 \le i,j \le n}$  endowed with the topology induced by  $\mathscr{L}(\ell_2^n)$  forms a non-abelian compact group. It is unimodular, and we denote the integral, with respect to the Haar measure on  $\mathscr{U}_n$ , of a function  $f \in L_2(\mathscr{U}_n)$  by

$$
\int_{u_n} f(U) dU.
$$

Integrals of this type form the so-called Weingarten calculus, which is of outstanding importance in random matrix theory, mathematical physics, and the theory of quantum information (see, e.g., [\[3, 14\]](#page-3-1)).

Basically, we will only need the precise values of two concrete integrals from the Weingarten calculus. The first one is

(8)

$$
\int_{\mathcal{U}_n} u_{i,j} \overline{u_{k,\ell}} dU = -\frac{1}{n} \delta_{i,k} \delta_{j,\ell}
$$

for all possible  $1 \le i, j, k, \ell \le n$ , and the second one

(9)

$$
\int_{\mathcal{U}_n} |\text{tr}(AU)|^2 dU = \frac{1}{n} \text{tr}(AA^*)
$$

for every *A* ∈  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$  (see, e.g., [\[2, p. 16\]](#page-2-1), [\[3\]](#page-2-1), or [\[22, Corollary 3.6\]](#page-2-1)).

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE PROJECTION CONSTANT OF THE TRACE CLASS                5

Every operator  $T: M_n(\mathbb{C}^n) \to M_n(\mathbb{C}^n)$  that leaves  $\mathcal{U}_n$  invariant (i.e.,  $T\mathcal{U}_n \subset \mathcal{U}_n$ ), defines a composition operator

$$
C_T: L_2(\mathcal{U}_n) \to L_2(\mathcal{U}_n), \ f \mapsto f \circ T.
$$

There are in fact two such operators *T*, leaving  $\mathcal{U}_n$  invariant, of special interest – the left and right multiplication operators  $L_V$  and  $R_V$  with respect to  $V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , which for  $U \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$  are given by

$$
L_V(U) = VU
$$

 and  
 
 $$
 R_V(U) = UV
 $$
 
A subspace  $S \subset L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  is said to be  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant whenever it is invariant under all possible composition operators  $C_{L_V}$  and  $C_{R_V}$  with  $V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ .

For any closed subspace  $S \subset L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , we denote by  $\pi_{L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)} : L_2(\mathcal{U}_n) \to L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  the orthogonal projection on  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  with range S.

1.2. **Unitary harmonics.** Denote by  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$  the space of all  $n \times n$ -matrices  $z = (z_{ij})$  with entries from  $\mathbb{C}$ . The subset of such matrices  $\alpha = (\alpha_{ij})$  with entries from  $\mathbb{N}_0$  is denoted by  $M_n(\mathbb{N}_0)$ . For  $z \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$  and  $\alpha = (\alpha_{ij}) \in M_n(\mathbb{N}_0)$  we define

$$
z^{\alpha} = \prod_{i,j=1}^{n} z_{ij}^{\alpha_{ij}}.
$$

The symbol  $\mathcal{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  stands for all polynomials  $f: M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}$  of the form

$$
f(z) = \sum_{(\alpha,\beta)\in J} c_{(\alpha,\beta)}(f) \ z^{\alpha} \overline{z}^{\beta},
$$

where *J* is a finite subset of pairs  $(\alpha, \beta) \in M_n(\mathbb{N}_0) \times M_n(\mathbb{N}_0)$ , and  $(c_{(\alpha,\beta)}(f))_{(\alpha,\beta)\in J}$  are complex coefficients. Observe that for every  $(\alpha, \beta) \in J$ 

$$
c_{(\alpha,\beta)}(f) = \frac{1}{\alpha!\beta!} \frac{\partial^k f}{\partial z^\alpha \partial \overline{z}^\beta}(0),
$$

which in particular shows that the monomial coefficients  $c_{(\alpha,\beta)}(f)$  of each  $f \in \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  are unique. Note that the linear space  $\mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  carries a natural inner product which for  $f, g \in \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  is given by

(10) 

$$
\left\langle f,g\right\rangle_{\mathfrak{P}} := \sum_{(\alpha,\beta)} \alpha!\,\beta!\,c_{(\alpha,\beta)}(f)\overline{c_{(\alpha,\beta)}(g)}.
$$

Every polynomial  $f \in \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  defines the differential operator  $f(D) : \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C})) \to \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  by

$$
f(D) g := \sum_{(\alpha,\beta)} c_{(\alpha,\beta)}(f) \frac{\partial^{k} g}{\partial z^{\alpha} \partial \overline{z}^{\beta}}, \quad g \in \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))
$$

and it is easy to verify that

(11)

$$
\langle f, g \rangle_{\mathfrak{P}} = f(D)\overline{g}(0).
$$

Given  $k \in \mathbb{N}$ , we denote by

$$
\mathfrak{P}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C}))
$$ 
 
 the subspace of all polynomials  $f \in \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$ , which are supported on the index set of all pairs  $(\alpha, \beta)$  for which  $|\alpha| + |\beta| = k$ , that is,  $c_{(\alpha, \beta)}(f) = 0$  whenever  $|\alpha| + |\beta| \neq k$ . Observe that for a given  $f \in \mathfrak{P}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$ , we have  $f(\lambda z) = \lambda^k f(z)$  for all  $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$  and  $z \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ . This property motivates to call such  $f$   $k$ -homogeneous. Moreover,
 
 (12) 

$$
\mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C})) = \text{span}\{\mathfrak{P}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C})) \colon k \in \mathbb{N}_0\}.
$$

The polynomial  $\mathbf{t} \in \mathfrak{P}_2(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  given by

$$
\mathbf{t}(A) := \operatorname{tr}(A^*A), \quad A \in M_n(\mathbb{C}),
$$

where tr :  $M_n(\mathbb{C}) \to \mathbb{C}$  denotes the trace, is of special importance, since then

$$
\Delta := \mathbf{t}(D) = \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z_{ij} \partial \overline{z_{ij}}} : \mathfrak{P}\big(M_n(\mathbb{C})\big) \to \mathfrak{P}\big(M_n(\mathbb{C})\big).
$$

is the Laplace operator. A polynomial  $f \in \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  is said to be harmonic, whenever  $\Delta f = 0$ , and we write

$$
\mathfrak{H}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))
$$

for the subspace of all harmonic polynomials in  $\mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$ , and  $\mathfrak{H}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  for all *k*-homogeneous, harmonic polynomials. Obviously,

(13) 

$$
\mathfrak{H}(M_n(\mathbb{C})) = \text{span}\{\mathfrak{H}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C})) : k \in \mathbb{N}_0\}.
$$

By  $\mathfrak{P}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  we denote the linear space of all restrictions  $f|_{\mathcal{U}_n}$  of polynomials  $f \in \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  to the unitary group. All restrictions of harmonic polynomials on  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$  to the unitary group are denoted by

$$
\mathfrak{H}(\mathscr{U}_n),
$$

and such polynomials we call unitary harmonics. Similarly, we denote by  $\mathfrak{P}_k(\mathscr{U}_n)$  and  $\mathfrak{H}_k(\mathscr{U}_n)$  the corresponding spaces of *k*-homogeneous polynomials restricted to  $\mathcal{U}_n$ . We need to introduce another notation. For  $p, q \in \mathbb{N}_0$  let

$$
\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathscr{U}_n) \subset \mathfrak{H}(\mathscr{U}_n)
$$

denote the space of all harmonic polynomials which are *p*-homogeneous in  $z = (z_{ij})$  and *q*-homogeneous in  $\overline{z} = (\overline{z_{ij}})$ , that is, all polynomials  $f : \mathcal{U}_n \to \mathbb{C}$  of the form

$$
f(z) = \sum_{\substack{z \in \mathcal{U}_n \\ |\alpha| = p, |\beta| = q}} c_{(\alpha,\beta)}(f) \ z^{\alpha} \overline{z}^{\beta}.
$$

Clearly, we have

(14) 

$$
\mathfrak{H}(\mathcal{U}_n) = \text{span}\left\{\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathcal{U}_n) : p, q \in \mathbb{N}_0\right\}
$$

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE PROJECTION CONSTANT OF THE TRACE CLASS               7

and  $\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  and  $\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  both form  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspaces of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . We denote by  $\pi_{(p,q)}$  the orthogonal projection of  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  onto  $\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$ .

**Remark 1.1.** An important difference between spherical harmonics and unitary harmonics is that for the case of the sphere the corresponding spaces  $\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathbb{S}_n)$  are mutually orthogonal in  $L_2(\mathbb{S}_n)$  (see [\[18, Theorem 12.2.3\]](#page-9-1)). But for the subspaces  $\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  of  $L^2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  this is no longer true. To see an example take  $f \in \mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  and  $g \in \mathfrak{H}_{(2,1)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  defined by  $f(U) = u_{1,1}$  and  $g(U) = \overline{u_{2,2}}u_{1,2}u_{2,1}$ . Then (see, e.g., [\[10, Section 4.2\]](#page-9-1))

(15) 

$$
\left\langle f,g \right\rangle_{L_{2}} = \int_{\mathscr{U}_{n}} u_{1,1} u_{2,2} \overline{u_{1,2} u_{2,1}} dU = -\frac{1}{(n-1)n(n+1)}.
$$

On the other hand, using basic properties of the Haar measure on  $\mathcal{U}_n$ , it is not difficult to prove that

(16) 

$$
\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathscr{U}_n) \perp \mathfrak{H}_{(p',q')}(\mathscr{U}_n) \quad \text{whenever} \quad p+q = p'+q' \quad \text{and} \quad (p,q) \neq (p',q')
$$

(see [\[9, §29\]](#page-9-1), or [\[14\]](#page-14-1)). Thus we have the following interesting remark not needed for our further purposes.

**Remark 1.2.**  $\mathfrak{H}_k(\mathcal{U}_n) = \mathfrak{H}_{(k,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n) \oplus \mathfrak{H}_{(k-1,1)}(\mathcal{U}_n) \oplus ... \oplus \mathfrak{H}_{(0,k)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , where  $\oplus$  indicates the orthogonal sum in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ .

Note also that in contrast to (15) we have  $\langle f, g \rangle_{\mathfrak{B}} = 0$ , so the Euclidean structure, which  $\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  inherits from  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , is different from that induced by the inner product from (10).

1.3. **Density.** Recall that all spherical harmonics on  $S_n$  are dense in  $C(S_n)$  (see, e.g., [\[18](#page-18-1), Section 12.1]). For unitary harmonics the following density theorem is an analog, which is crucial for our coming purposes.

**Theorem 1.3.**  $\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  is dense in  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , and hence also in  $L^2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ .

We prepare the proof with two independently interesting lemmas.

**Lemma 1.4.** *Given*  $k otin \mathbb{N}$ *,*

$$
\mathfrak{P}_{k}(M_{n}(\mathbb{C})) = \mathfrak{H}_{k}(M_{n}(\mathbb{C})) \oplus \mathbf{t} \cdot \mathfrak{H}_{k-2}(M_{n}(\mathbb{C})) \oplus \mathbf{t}^{2} \cdot \mathfrak{H}_{k-4}(M_{n}(\mathbb{C})) \oplus \dots
$$

where the last term of the sum is the span of  $\mathbf{t}^{k/2}$  for even k, and  $\mathbf{t}^{(k-1)/2} \cdot \mathfrak{H}_1(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  for odd k; the symbol  $\oplus$  denotes the orthogonal sum with respect to the inner product  $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\mathfrak{N}}$  given by the definition in  [\(10\)](#).

8                DEFANT, GALICER, MANSILLA, MASTYŁO, AND MURO

*Proof.* Given  $g \in \mathfrak{P}_{k-2}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$ , let us for  $A \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$  define

$$
h(A) = \mathbf{t}(A)g(A).
$$

Note that, since  $t(D) = \Delta$ , we have  $h(D) = \Delta \circ g(D) = g(D) \circ \Delta$ . Let  $f \in \mathfrak{P}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$ , then by [\(11\)](#page-9-1)

$$
\langle h, f \rangle_{\mathfrak{P}} = [h(D)\overline{f}](0) = [g(D)(\Delta \overline{f})](0) = \langle g, \Delta f \rangle_{\mathfrak{P}}.
$$

Thus,  $f \perp \mathbf{t}g$  for every  $g \in \mathfrak{P}_{k-2}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  if and only if  $\Delta f \perp g$  for every  $g \in \mathfrak{P}_{k-2}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  if and only  $\Delta f = 0$ , that is,  $f \in \mathfrak{H}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$ , and consequently

$$
\mathfrak{P}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C})) = \mathfrak{H}_k(M_n(\mathbb{C})) \oplus \mathbf{t} \cdot \mathfrak{P}_{k-2}(M_n(\mathbb{C})).
$$

 $\Box$ 

The proof finishes repeating this procedure for  $\mathfrak{P}_{k-2}(M_n(\mathbb{C})), \mathfrak{P}_{k-4}(M_n(\mathbb{C})), \ldots$ 

**Lemma 1.5.** For each  $k \in \mathbb{N}$  we have

(17) 

$$
\mathfrak{P}_{k}(\mathcal{U}_{n}) = span\{\mathfrak{H}_{\ell}(\mathcal{U}_{n}) \colon \ell \le k\}
$$

*Consequently, for every*  $f \in \mathfrak{P}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  *there is*  $g \in \mathfrak{H}(M_n(\mathbb{C}))$  *such that both functions coincide on*  $\mathcal{U}_n$ .

*Proof.* Since  $t(U) = n$  for every  $U \\in \\mathcal{U}_n$ , the assertion in [\(17\)](#eq-17) is a consequence of Lemma 1.4. Then the last claim follows from [\(12\)](#eq-12).  $\Box$ 

Now we are ready for the

*Proof of Theorem 1.3.* Note first that  $\mathfrak{P}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  is a subalgebra of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which is closed under conjugation, and that the collection of all coordinate functions  $z_{ij}$  separates the points of  $\mathcal{U}_n$ . Thus, by the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem,  $\mathfrak{P}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  is dense in  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , and consequently the claimed density is an immediate consequence of Lemma 1.5.  $\Box$ 

# 2. PROJECTION CONSTANTS

As explained in the introduction the superior goal of this work is to prove the following result.

## **Theorem 2.1.** *For each* $n \in \mathbb{N}$ *,*

(18) 

$$
\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathscr{S}_1(n)\big) = \left\|\pi_{(1,0)}:C(\mathscr{U}_n) \to \mathscr{S}_1(n)\right\| = n\int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |\text{tr}(V)|dV.
$$

Moreover,

(19) 

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\lambda(\mathscr{S}_1(n))}{n} = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}.
$$

The proof of this is presented in Section 2.5. In the following we take time to prepare the arguments needed.

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE PROJECTION CONSTANT OF THE TRACE CLASS            9

2.1. **Rudin's averaging technique.** Given a topological group  $G$  and a Banach space  $Y$ , we say that  $G$  acts on  $Y$  (through  $T$ ) whenever there is a mapping

$$
T: G \to \mathcal{L}(Y), \ g \mapsto T_g
$$

such that

$$
T_{e} = I_{\gamma}, \quad T_{gh} = T_{g}T_{h}, \quad g, h \in G
$$

and all mappings

$$
g \ni G \mapsto T_g(y) \in Y, \quad y \in Y
$$

are continuous. If in addition all operators  $T_g$ ,  $g \in G$  are isometries, then we say that G acts isometrically on Y. We say that  $S \in \mathcal{L}(Y)$  commutes with the action T of G on Y whenever S commutes with all  $T_h$ ,  $h \in G$ .

The following theorem was presented in [\[17\]](#page-1-1) (see also [21, Theorem III.B.13]).

**Theorem 2.2.** Let Y be a Banach space, X a complemented subspace of Y, and  $\mathbf{Q}: Y \to Y$  a projection onto X. Suppose that G is a compact group with Haar measure  $m$ , which acts on Y through T such *that*  $X$  *is invariant under the action of*  $G$ *, that is,*  $T_g(X) \subset X$  *for all*  $g \in G$ *. Then*  $\mathbf{P}: Y \to Y$  *given by* 

(20) 

$$
\mathbf{P}(y) := \int_G T_{g^{-1}} \mathbf{Q} T_g(y) \, d\mathbf{m}(g), \quad y \in Y
$$

is a projection onto X which commutes with the action of G on Y (meaning that  $T_g \mathbf{P} = \mathbf{P} T_g$  for all  $g \in G$ ) and satisfies

$$
\|\mathbf{P}\| \le \|\mathbf{Q}\| \sup_{g \in G} \|T_g\|^2.
$$

Moreover, if there is a unique projection on  $Y$  onto  $X$  that commutes with the action of  $G$  on  $Y$ , and if  $G$  acts isometrically on  $Y$ , then **P** given in (20) is minimal, i.e.,

$$
\boldsymbol{\lambda}(X,Y) = \|\mathbf{P}\|.
$$

In order to be able to apply Rudin's technique, we need to endow  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  with a special group structure, which allows to represent the resulting group in  $\mathcal{L}(C(\mathcal{U}_n))$ . To do so, consider on  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  the multiplication

$$
(U_0, V_0) \cdot (U_1, V_1) := (U_1 U_0, V_0 V_1).
$$

With this multiplication and endowed with the product topology,  $\mathscr{U}_n \times \mathscr{U}_n$  turns into a compact topological group, and it may be seen easily that the Haar measure on  $\mathscr{U}_n \times \mathscr{U}_n$  is given by the product measure of the Haar measure on  $\mathscr{U}_n$  with itself.

Further, for any  $(U, V) \in \mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  and any  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  we define

$$
\rho_{(U,V)}f:=(C_{L_U}\circ C_{R_V})f=f\circ L_U\circ R_V,
$$

10         DEFANT, GALICER, MANSILLA, MASTYŁO, AND MURO

which leads to an action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  given by

(21)

$$
\qquad \qquad \mathscr{U}_{n} \times \mathscr{U}_{n} \to \mathscr{L}\big(C(\mathscr{U}_{n})\big), \quad (U,V) \mapsto \big[\rho_{(U,V)} : f \mapsto f \circ L_{U} \circ R_{V}\big].
$$

We say that a mapping  $T : S_1 \to S_2$ , where  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  both are  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspaces of  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , whenever 

$$
(C_{L_{U}} \circ C_{R_{V}})(Tf) = T((C_{L_{U}} \circ C_{R_{V}})f) for every  (U, V) \in \mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_v  and  f \in S_1 .
$$

2.2. **Convolution.** Recall from Section 1.1 that  $\pi_S : L_2(\mathcal{U}_n) \to S$  denotes the orthogonal projection on  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  onto a given closed subspace *S*. The following result shows that under the assumption of  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariance of *S*, this projection is a convolution operator with respect to some kernel in *S*.

**Theorem 2.3.** Let S be a  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspace of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which is closed in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Then the following holds true:

- (i) There is a unique function  $t_S \in S$  such that for all  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ 

$$
\pi_S f = f * \mathrm{t}_S
$$

- (ii)  $\pi_S$  commutes with all  $L_U$  and  $R_U$  for  $U \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , that is,  $\pi_S$  commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$ on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ ,

- $(iii) \|\pi_S: C(\mathscr{U}_n) \to S\| = \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |\mathsf{t}_S(V)| dV.$

The proof is an easy consequence of the following lemma.

**Lemma 2.4.** Let S be a  $\mathscr{U}_n$ -invariant subspace of  $C(\mathscr{U}_n)$ , which is closed in  $L_2(\mathscr{U}_n)$ . Then for every  $U \in \mathscr{U}_n$ , there exists a unique function  $K_{U}^S \in S$  such that for all  $f \in L_2(\mathscr{U}_n)$ 

(i)  $(\pi_S f)(U) = \langle f, K_U^S \rangle_{L_2} = \int_{\mathcal{U}_n} f(V) \overline{K_U^S(V)} dV,$ 

and moreover for every choice of  $U, V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , we have

(ii)  $K_U^S(V) = \langle K_U^S, K_V^S \rangle_{L_2} = \overline{K_V^S(U)}$ , 

(iii)  $K_U^S \circ L_{V-1} = K_{VU}^S = K_V^S \circ R_{U-1}$ , 

(iv)  $K_V^S(V) = K_{Id}^S(Id) > 0$ .

*Proof.* The claim from  $(i)$  is an immediate consequence of the Riesz representation theorem applied to the continuous linear functional  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n) \to \mathbb{C}$ ,  $f \mapsto (\pi_S f)(U)$ .

(ii) $K_{U}^{S}(V) = \pi_{S}(K_{U}^{S})(V) = \langle K_{U}^{S}, K_{V}^{S} \rangle_{L_{2}} = \overline{\langle K_{V}^{S}, K_{U}^{S} \rangle_{L_{2}}} = \overline{K_{V}^{S}(U)} \text{ for all } V \in \mathcal{U}_{n}.$

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE PROJECTION CONSTANT OF THE TRACE CLASS         11

(*iii*) Fix some  $V \in \mathcal{U}_n$  and  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , and note first that  $S^{\perp}$  is also  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant. Then

$$
(Id - \pi_S)(f) \circ L_V \in S^{\perp}
 and  f \circ L_V = \pi_S(f) \circ L_V + (Id - \pi_S)(f) \circ L_V
$$

and hence

(22) 

$$
\pi_S(f \circ L_V) = \pi_S(\pi_S(f) \circ L_V) + \pi_S((Id - \pi_S)(f) \circ L_V) = \pi_S(f) \circ L_V.
$$

Then

$$
\left\langle f, K_{VU}^{S} \right\rangle_{L_{2}} = \pi_{S}(f)(VU) = \pi_{S}(f) \circ L_{V}(U) = \pi_{s}(f \circ L_{V})(U),
$$

and thus by  $(i)$ 

$$
\left\langle f, K_{VU}^{S} \right\rangle_{L_{2}} = \left\langle f \circ L_{V}, K_{U}^{S} \right\rangle_{L_{2}} = \left\langle C_{L_{V}}f, K_{U}^{S} \right\rangle_{L_{2}} = \left\langle f, C_{L_{V^{-1}}}K_{U}^{S} \right\rangle_{L_{2}} = \left\langle f, K_{U}^{S} \circ L_{V^{-1}} \right\rangle_{L_{2}}
$$

Since  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  was chosen arbitrarily, we obtain that  $K_{VU}^S = K_U^S \circ L_{V^{-1}}$ . The other identity follows similarly. 

$(iv)$  Let  $V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , then

$$
K_V^S(V) = \left\langle K_V^S, K_V^S \right\rangle_{L_2} = \left\langle K_{Id}^S \circ L_{V^{-1}}, K_V^S \right\rangle_{L_2} = \left\langle K_{Id}^S, K_V^S \circ L_V \right\rangle_{L_2} = \left\langle K_{Id}^S, K_{Id}^S \right\rangle_{L_2} = K_{Id}^S(Id) > 0. \quad \Box
$$

It remains to prove Theorem 2.3. Defining

(23) 

$$
t_{S} := K_{Id}^{S},
$$

this proof is in fact a straight forward consequence of the preceding lemma. But before we do this, we collect two elementary properties of the kernel  $t_{S}$ .

**Remark 2.5.** Let *S* be a  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspace of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which is closed in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Then  $t_S = K_{Id}^S$  satisfies:

- $t_S(V^*) = \overline{t_S(V)}$  for all  $V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ ,
- $t_S(V^*UV) = t_S(U)$  for all  $U, V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , that is,  $t_S$  is a so-called class function.

Indeed, for the first equality note that

$$
t_{S}(V^{*}) = (K_{Id}^{S} \circ L_{V^{-1}})(Id) = K_{V}^{S}(Id) = \overline{K_{Id}^{S}(V)} = \overline{t_{S}(V)},
$$

and together with this we get

$$
\mathsf{t}_{S}(V^{-1}UV) = \overline{\mathsf{t}_{S}(V^{-1}U^{*}V)} = \overline{(K_{Id}^{S} \circ L_{V^{-1}})(U^{*}V)}
$$

$$
= \overline{K_{V}^{S}(U^{*}V)} = K_{U^{*}V}^{S}(V) = K_{Id}^{S} \circ R_{V^{-1}U}(V) = \mathsf{t}_{S}(U).
$$

12               DEFANT, GALICER, MANSILLA, MASTYŁO, AND MURO

Proof of *Theorem 2.3.* By Lemma 2.4 for all  $U in \mathcal{U}_n$  and  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ 

$$
(\pi_S f)(U) = \int_{\mathcal{U}_n} f(V) \overline{K_U^S(V)} dV
$$
  
= 
$$
\int_{\mathcal{U}_n} f(V) K_V^S(U) dV
$$
  
= 
$$
\int_{\mathcal{U}_n} f(V) K_{Id}^S(UV^{-1}) dV = \int_{\mathcal{U}_n} f(V) \mathsf{t}_S(UV^*) dV = (f * \mathsf{t}_S)(U),
$$

which proves (i). Statement (ii) was already shown in (22), and it remains to check (iii). Obviously, we have that

$$
\|\pi_{S}: C(\mathcal{U}_{n}) \to S\| = \sup_{U \in \mathcal{U}_{n}} \int_{\mathcal{U}_{n}} |\text{t}_{S}(UV^{*})| dV
$$

and for every  $U \\in \\mathcal{U}_n$  by Remark 2.5

$$
\int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |\mathsf{t}_S(UV^*)| dV = \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |\mathsf{t}_S(V^*)| dV = \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |\mathsf{t}_S(V)| dV.
$$

This completes the argument.

2.3. **Accessibility.** Let *S* be some  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspace of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which is closed in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Then *S* is called accessible if every projection *Q* on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  onto *S*, which commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , equals  $\pi_{S|_{C(\mathcal{U}_n)}}$ .

**Theorem 2.6.** Let *S* be a  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant and accessible subspace of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which is closed in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Then

$$
\boldsymbol{\lambda}(S) = \left\| \pi_S : C(\mathscr{U}_n) \to S \right\| = \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |t_S(V)| dV.
$$

*Proof.* The proof is an immediate consequence of Rudin's Theorem 2.2 and the assumptions on *S*, taking into account that we know  $(ii)$  and  $(iii)$  from Theorem 2.3 as well as (1).  $\Box$ 

We say that a  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspace *S* of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which is closed in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , is strongly accessible, whenever every  $f \in S$  for which  $f(VUV^*) = f(U)$  for all  $U, V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , is a scalar multiple of  $t_s$ . In other words, every class function in  $S$  is a multiple of  $t_s$ .

As the name in the previous definition suggests, we have the following key result.

**Proposition 2.7.** Let S be a  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspace of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which is closed in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Then S is accessible whenever it is strongly accessible.

The proof requires the next statement.П

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE PROJECTION CONSTANT OF THE TRACE CLASS 13

**Lemma 2.8.** Let H and S be  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspaces of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which are both closed in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Then, if S is accessible, every operator  $T : H \to S$  that commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , is a scalar multiple of  $\pi_S$ .

Moreover, if H is orthogonal to S and Q is a projection on  $H \oplus S$  onto S that commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , then  $Q = \pi_{S|_{H \oplus S}}$ .

*Proof.* By the assumption on T and Lemma 2.4, (iii) for every  $V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ ,

$$
(C_{L_{V}} \circ C_{R_{V-1}})(Tt_{H}) = T((C_{L_{V}} \circ C_{R_{V-1}})t_{H}) = Tt_{H}.
$$

This implies that  $(Tt_H)(V^*UV) = (Tt_H)(U)$  for all  $U, V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ . Since S is accessible, we have that  $Tt_H = \gamma t_S$  for some  $\gamma \in \mathbb{C}$ . But from Theorem 2.3 we know that for all  $h \in H$ 

$$
h = \pi_H h = h \ast t_H
$$

and hence

$$
Th = h * Tt_{H} = \gamma h * t_{S} = \gamma \pi_{S} h.
$$

To see the second assertion, note that by the first part of the lemma we have  $Q|_{H} = \gamma \pi_{S|_{H}}$  for some  $\gamma \in \mathbb{C}$ . But since by assumption  $H \subset S^{\perp}$ , this implies  $Q|_{H} = 0 = \pi_{S|_{H}}$ . On the other hand, since Q is a projection onto *S*, we see that  $Q|_{S} = Id_S = \pi_{S|_{S}}$ , which finishes the proof.  $\Box$ 

We now give a

*Proof of Proposition 2.7.* Let *Q* be a projection on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  onto *S*, which commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . By Theorem 1.3 (the density theorem), it suffices to show that for each  $(p,q) \in \mathbb{N}_0 \times \mathbb{N}_0$ 

$$
Q|_{\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}} = \pi S|_{\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}}
$$

Given such pair  $(p, q)$ , we define the subspace

$$
H := \{f - \pi_S f : f \in \mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}\} \subset C(\mathscr{U}_n).
$$

Then *H* is  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant; indeed, by Theorem 2.3, (ii) and the fact that  $\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}$  is  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant, for every  $f \in \mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}$  and  $U \in \mathscr{U}_n$  we have

$$
(f - \pi_S f) \circ L_U = f \circ L_U - \pi_S f \circ L_U = f \circ L_U - \pi_S (f \circ L_U) \in H,
$$

and the invariance under right multiplication follows similarly. Since  $H \perp S$  and  $Q$  commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , Lemma 2.8 (the second part applied to the restriction of  $Q$  to  $H \oplus S$ ) shows that

$$
Q|_{H\oplus S} = \pi S|_{H\oplus S'}
$$

14          DEFANT, GALICER, MANSILLA, MASTYŁO, AND MURO

so in particular  $Q|_{H} = \pi_{S|_{H}} = 0$ . But then for every  $f \in \mathfrak{H}(\mathcal{U}_{n})$ 

$$
Q(f) = Q(f - \pi_S f) + Q(\pi_S f) = \pi_S f,
$$

which completes the argument.

2.4. **The special case**  $S = \mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Recall from Section 1.2 the definition of the  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspace  $\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  of all polynomials  $f \in C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  of the form

$$
f(U) = \sum_{1 \le i,j \le n} c_{i,j} u_{i,j},
$$

where  $U = (u_{i,j})_{1 \le i,j \le n} \in \mathcal{U}_n$ .

In Theorem 2.3 we show that the orthogonal projection  $\pi_{(1,0)} = \pi_{\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)}$  on  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  onto  $\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$ is a convolution operator with respect to the kernel  $t_{(1,0)} = t_{\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)}$ . We need an alternative description of this projection in terms of the canonical orthonormal basis of  $\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$ .

By (8) the collection of all normalized functions  $\sqrt{n}e_{ij}$ ,  $1 \leq i, j \leq n$  forms an orthonormal system in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , and hence an orthonormal basis of  $\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  considered as a subspace of  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Consequently, for each  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ 

(24) 

$$
\pi_{(1,0)}(f) = \sum_{1 \le i,j \le n} \left\langle f, \sqrt{n} e_{ij} \right\rangle_{L_2} \sqrt{n} e_{ij} = n \sum_{1 \le i,j \le n} \left\langle f, e_{ij} \right\rangle_{L_2} e_{ij},
$$

where  $e_{ij} \in \mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n)$  is defined by  $e_{ij}(U) = u_{i,j}$  for  $U \in \mathscr{U}_n$ .

Comparing the two representations of  $\pi_{(1,0)}$  we now have, leads to the following

**Proposition 2.9.** *For each*  $n \in \mathbb{N}$  *we have*  $t_{(1,0)} = n \operatorname{tr}$ *, and moreover*

$$
\pi_{(1,0)}f = n \ (f \ast \text{tr}) \text{,} \quad f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)
$$

 $and$ 

$$
\|\pi_{(1,0)}:C(\mathcal{U}_n)\to\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)\|=n\int_{\mathcal{U}_n}|\text{tr}(V)|dV
$$

*Proof.* To check the equality  $t_{(1,0)} = n \text{tr}$ , recall that by Lemma 2.4, (i) and the definition of  $t_{(1,0)}$ from (23), for all  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  one gets

$$
(\pi_{(1,0)}f)(Id) = \langle f, \mathsf{t}_{(1,0)} \rangle_{L_2}
$$

On the other hand, by (24) for all  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ ,

$$
(\pi_{(1,0)}f)(Id) = n\sum_{i,j} \left\langle f, e_{ij} \right\rangle_{L_2} e_{ij}(Id) = n\sum_i \left\langle f, e_{ii} \right\rangle_{L_2} = n\left\langle f, \text{tr} \right\rangle_{L_2},
$$

which together with the preceding equality is what we were looking for. To deduce the second and third claim, is then immediate from Theorem 2.3,  $(iii)$ . П $\Box$ 

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE PROJECTION CONSTANT OF THE TRACE CLASS               15

**Proposition 2.10.**  $\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  is a strongly accessible  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspace of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ .

*Proof.* Take  $f = \sum_{1 \le i, j \le n} c_{i,j} e_{i,j} \in \mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  such that  $f(V^{-1}UV) = f(U)$  for every  $U, V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ . Clearly, *f* can be considered as a linear functional on  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ . This implies that there exists  $A \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$  such that  $f(U) = \text{tr}(AU)$  for all  $U \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ . Then from the assumption on  $f$ , it follows that for all  $U, V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ 

$$
tr(AU) = f(U) = f(V^{-1}UV) = tr(AV^{-1}UV) = tr(VAV^{-1}U).
$$

Combining this with the fact that any matrix in  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$  is a linear combination of unitary matrices, we deduce that  $A = VAV^{-1}$  for every  $V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , and so A commutes with all matrices in  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ . This implies that  $A = \gamma Id$  for some  $\gamma \in \mathbb{C}$ , and hence as desired  $f = \gamma \text{tr.}$   $\Box$ 

A comment is in order: if  $p + q > 1$  then  $g_1(A) := tr(A^p(A^*)^q)$  and  $g_2(A) := tr(A^p)tr(A^*)^q$  are different class functions. Thus, in this case,  $\mathfrak{H}_{(p,q)}(\mathscr{U}_n)$  is not strongly accessible.

The following result identifies  $\mathcal{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  with the trace class  $\mathcal{S}_1(n)$ .

**Proposition 2.11.** *The space*  $\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$  *is isometrically isomorphic to*  $\mathscr{S}_1(n)$ *. More precisely,*

(25) 

$$
\mathcal{S}_1(n) \to \mathcal{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n), \ A \mapsto [f:U \mapsto tr(AU)]
$$ 

is an isometry onto.

*Proof.* Obviously, the mapping in (25) is a linear bijection. Indeed, as a linear space  $\mathscr{S}_1(n)$  equals  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ , and  $\mathfrak{S}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n)$  equals the algebraic dual  $M_n(\mathbb{C})^*$  of  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ . Moreover, it is well-known that the mapping  $A \to [f : U \to \text{tr}(AU)]$  identifies  $M_n(\mathbb{C})$  and  $M_n(\mathbb{C})^*$ . So it remains to prove that the mapping in (25) is isometric. To prove that, we use a result of Nelson [15] (see also [8, Theorem 1]) showing that for any complex-valued function  $f$ , which is continuous on the closed and analytic on the open unit ball of  $\mathscr{L}(\ell_2^n)$ , we have  $\sup_{\|T\| \leq 1} |f(T)| = \sup_{U \in \mathscr{U}_n} |f(U)|$ . But then by (7) for every  $A \in \mathscr{S}_1(n)$ 

$$
||A||_{1} = \sup_{||T|| \le 1} |\text{tr}(AT)| = \sup_{U \in \mathcal{U}_{n}} |\text{tr}(AU)|,
$$

completing the argument.

## 2.5. **Proof of the main result.** We start by presenting the

*Proof of the integral formula from* (18). We use the identification from Proposition 2.11, and combine it with Proposition 2.10 and Theorem 2.6. Then Proposition 2.9 completes the argument.  $\Box$ 

Now we deal with the limit formula from (19). For this we need to recall some well-known results from probability theory (for more on this see [\[1\]](#page-1-1)). We are going to use that, given any sequence  $(Y_n)$ П

16             DEFANT, GALICER, MANSILLA, MASTYŁO, AND MURO

of random variables, which converges in distribution to the random variable  $Y$ , and any continuous real-valued function  $f$ , the sequence  $(f(Y_n))$  converges in distribution to  $f(Y)$ . Recall also that a sequence  $(Y_n)_n$  of random variables is said to be uniformly integrable whenever

$$
\lim_{a \to \infty} \sup_{n \ge 1} \int_{\left|Y_n\right| \ge a} \left|Y_n\right| dP = 0.
$$

Uniform integrability will be useful for us due to the fact (see for example [\[1\]](#page-1-1), Theorem 3.5) that if  $(Y_n)_{n}$  is a uniformly integrable sequence of random variables and  $Y_n \xrightarrow{D} Y$ , then Y is integrable and

$$
(26) \qquad \mathbb{E}(Y_n) \to \mathbb{E}(Y).
$$

To check uniform integrability we cite a standard criterion.

**Remark 2.12.** If  $\sup_n \mathbb{E}(|Y_n|^{1+\varepsilon}) \leq C$  for some  $\varepsilon, C > 0$ , then  $(Y_n)_n$  is uniformly integrable; indeed, this is a consequence of

$$
\lim_{a \to \infty} \sup_{n \ge 1} \int_{|Y_n| \ge a} |Y_n| dP \le \lim_{a \to \infty} \frac{1}{a^{\varepsilon}} C.
$$

We are now ready to provide the

*Proof of the limit formula from* (19). Consider the sequence  $(\text{tr}(U(n)))$  of random variables on  $\mathcal{U}_n$ , where  $U(n)$  is a unitary matrix uniformly Haar distributed. Then, by [\[11, Corollary 2.4\]](#page-9-1) (see also [\[5\]](#page-9-1) or [\[16, Problem 8.5.5\]](#page-9-1)), the previous sequence converges in distribution to the standard Gaussian complex random variable  $\gamma$ . Indeed, the random variables  $\sqrt{2}Re[tr(U(n))]$  and  $\sqrt{2}Im[tr(U(n))]$  converge in distribution to a standard real Gaussian random variable.

Thus, the sequence  $(\sqrt{2}|tr(U(n))|)$  of random variables on  $\mathcal{U}_n$  converges in distribution to a Rayleigh random variable. Moreover, since as mentioned in ([9](#page-9-1)), for each  $n$ 

$$
\mathbb{E}\big(|\mathrm{tr}(U(n))|^2\big) = \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |\mathrm{tr}(V)|^2 \, dV = 1 \, ,
$$

the sequence of random variables  $tr(U(n))$  by Remark [2.12](#Remark-2.12) is uniformly integrable. Consequently, we deduce from (26) that  $(\mathbb{E}(\sqrt{2}|tr(U(n))|))$  converges to the expectation of a Rayleigh random variable.

That is,

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E} \big( \sqrt{2} \, |\mathrm{tr}(U(n))| \big) \to \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}.
$$

Using  $(18)$ , we arrive at

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \lambda(\mathscr{S}_1(n)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E} (\sqrt{2} |\text{tr}(U(n))|) = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2},
$$

which completes the proof.

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE PROJECTION CONSTANT OF THE TRACE CLASS            17

2.6. **Another examples.** In this final section we give some other examples where the theory developed to reach our main objective (Theorem 2.1) could be applied.

The first result shows that examples of accessible  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspaces come in pairs. To see this we define the linear and isometric bijection

$$
\phi: C(\mathcal{U}_n) \to C(\mathcal{U}_n), \ f \mapsto [U \mapsto f(U^*)].
$$

For any subspace *S* in  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , we write  $S_* := \phi S$ . As a first example we mention that isometrically

$$
\left(\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\right)_* = \phi\big(\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\big) = \mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\,.
$$

**Proposition 2.13.** Let S be a  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspace of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which is closed in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Then  $S_*$  is  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant and  $t_{S_*} = \overline{t_S}$ . Moreover, S is strongly accessible (resp., accessible) if and only if  $S_*$  is strongly accessible (resp., accessible).

*Proof.* Obviously,  $S_*$  is  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant. In order to show that  $t_{S_*} = \overline{t_S}$  note first that  $\pi_{S_*} = \phi \circ \pi_S \circ \phi$ . Then for every  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  and  $U \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , it follows by Theorem 2.3 and Remark 2.5 that

$$
\begin{split} \big(\pi_{S_*}f\big)(U) &= \big((\pi_S\phi f)\big)(U^*) \\ &= \big(\phi f \ast \mathsf{t}_S\big)(U^*) = \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} f(V^*) \mathsf{t}_S(U^*V^*) dV \\ &= \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} f(V^*) \overline{\mathsf{t}_S}(VU) dV = \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} f(V) \overline{\mathsf{t}_S}(V^*U) dV \\ &= \int_{\mathscr{U}_n} f(V) \overline{\mathsf{t}_S}(UV^*) dV = \big(f \ast \overline{\mathsf{t}_S}\big)(U) \,, \end{split}
$$

which by the uniqueness of  $t_{S_*}$  leads to the claim. Let us turn to the 'moreover part'. It is immediate that strong accessibility of *S* is equivalent to strong accessibility of  $S_*$ . So let us assume that *S* is accessible, and show that then  $S_*$  is accessible. Take any projection  $Q: C(\mathcal{U}_n) \to S_*$  which commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . Since  $\phi \circ C_{L_V} = R_{V^*} \circ \phi$  and  $\phi \circ C_{R_V} = L_{V^*} \circ \phi$  for all  $V \in \mathcal{U}_n$ , the projection  $\phi \circ Q \circ \phi$  onto *S* commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , and hence by assumption  $\phi \circ Q \circ \phi = \pi_S$ . But then clearly  $Q = \phi \circ \pi_S \circ \phi = \pi_{S_*}$ , the conclusion.  $\Box$ 

Note that, in particular,  $\mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)$  is  $\mathscr{U}_n$ -invariant and accessible, and  $t_{(0,1)} = \overline{\text{tr}}$  and therefore by Theorem 2.6

$$
\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\big) = \left\|\pi_{(0,1)}:C(\mathscr{U}_n)\to\mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\right\| = n\int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |\mathrm{tr}(V)|dV
$$

Also,

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\big)}{n}=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}.
$$

Of course, this is also a simple consequence of Theorem 2.1 using that  $\phi$  identifies  $\mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)$  and  $\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n)$  isometrically.

18             DEFANT, GALICER, MANSILLA, MASTYŁO, AND MURO

We continue with another simple stability property of accessible subspaces.

**Proposition 2.14.** Let  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  be accessible,  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant subspaces of  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , which in  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  are *closed and orthogonal.* Then,  $S_1 \oplus S_2$  is accessible and  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant, and moreover  $t_{S_1 \oplus S_2} = t_{S_1} + t_{S_2}$ . *Consequently,*

(27)

$$
\lambda(S_1 \oplus S_2) = \|\pi_{S_1} + \pi_{S_2} : C(\mathcal{U}_n) \to S_1 \oplus S_2 \| = \int_{\mathcal{U}_n} |t_{S_1}(V) + t_{S_2}(V)| dV.
$$

*Proof.* That  $S_1 \oplus S_2$  is  $\mathcal{U}_n$ -invariant is straightforward. Note that  $\pi_{S_1 \oplus S_2} = \pi_{S_1} + \pi_{S_2}$  is the orthogonal projection on  $L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  onto  $S_1 \oplus S_2$ . Then by Theorem 2.3 for all  $f \in L_2(\mathcal{U}_n)$  we have

$$
\pi_{S_1 \oplus S_2} f = \pi_{S_1} f + \pi_{S_2} f = f \ast \mathsf{t}_{S_1} + f \ast \mathsf{t}_{S_2} = f \ast (\mathsf{t}_{S_1} + \mathsf{t}_{S_2}).
$$

Hence by the uniqueness of  $t_{S_1 \oplus S_2}$  we get

$$
\mathbf{t}_{S_1 \oplus S_2} = \mathbf{t}_{S_1} + \mathbf{t}_{S_2} \, .
$$

Let us now show that  $S_1 \oplus S_2$  is accessible. So let *Q* be a projection on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  onto  $S_1 \oplus S_2$  which commutes with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ . We claim that  $Q = \pi_{S_1 \oplus S_2}$ . Indeed, consider the two projections

$$
Q_{S_1} = \pi_{S_1} \circ Q
$$

 and  $Q_{S_2} = \pi_{S_2} \circ Q$ 

on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  onto  $S_1$  and  $S_2$ , respectively. Since  $\pi_{S_1}$  and  $\pi_{S_2}$  both commute with the action of  $\mathcal{U}_n \times \mathcal{U}_n$  

on  $C(\mathcal{U}_n)$ , also  $Q_{S_1}$  and  $Q_{S_2}$  do. Then by the accessibility of  $S_1$  and  $S_2$  we see that

$$
Q_{S_1} = \pi_{S_1}
$$

 and 

$$
Q_{S_2} = \pi_{S_2}
$$
,

and hence for all  $f \in C(\mathcal{U}_n)$  as desired

$$
Qf = \pi_{S_1}(Qf) + \pi_{S_2}(Qf) = \pi_{S_1}f + \pi_{S_2}f = \pi_{S_1 \oplus S_2}f.
$$

To conclude the proof just note that (27) is then a direct consequence of Theorem 2.6.

Combining the previous two propositions we obtain

## **Corollary 2.15.** *For each* $n \in \mathbb{N}$ *,*

$$
\begin{split} \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\oplus\mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\big) &= \left\|\pi_{(1,0)}\oplus\pi_{(0,1)}:C(\mathscr{U}_n)\to\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\oplus\mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\right\| \\ &= 2n\int_{\mathscr{U}_n} |Re(\mathrm{tr}(V))|dV\,. \end{split}
$$

Moreover,

(28) 

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\boldsymbol{\lambda} \big( \mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n) \oplus \mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n) \big)}{\sqrt{2}n} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}
$$

AN INTEGRAL FORMULA FOR THE PROJECTION CONSTANT OF THE TRACE CLASS              19

Before giving a proof of this, we mention that the denominator of the fraction above (so  $\sqrt{2n}$ ) is exactly the square root of the dimension of the sum space  $\mathcal{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathcal{U}_n) \oplus \mathcal{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathcal{U}_n)$ .

*Proof of Corollary 2.15.* We only have to prove  $(28)$  since the integral formula for the projection constant follows directly from  $(27)$  and Proposition 2.9.We repeat an argument similar to the proof of [\(19\)](#page-19-0). 

We know, by [11, Corollary 2.4], that the sequence  $(\sqrt{2}Re[\text{tr}(U(n))])$  of random variables converges in distribution to a standard real Gaussian random variable g. In particular,  $(\sqrt{2}|Re[\text{tr}(U(n))]|)$  converges in distribution to |g|. Note that the sequence  $(\sqrt{2}|Re[\text{tr}(U(n))]|)$  is uniformly integrable. Indeed,  $\mathbb{E}(|Re[\text{tr}(U(n))]|^2) \leq \mathbb{E}(|\text{tr}(U(n))|^2) = 1$  (see again Remark 2.12). Thus by (26),

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathfrak{H}_{(1,0)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\oplus\mathfrak{H}_{(0,1)}(\mathscr{U}_n)\big)}{\sqrt{2}n}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{E}\big(\sqrt{2}|Re[\mathrm{tr}(U(n))]\big|\big)=\mathbb{E}|g|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{\mathbb{R}}|x|e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}dx=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}.
$$

This concludes the proof.
