It collects sensory data related to tomato detection, ripeness estimation, etc. It may also be used for autonomous navigation and robot control. - 2) Behavior modules: These modules process the sensory data and generate desired actions based on predefined behaviors. Each behavior module focuses on a specific task, such as locating ripe tomatoes, avoiding obstacles, or navigating through rows. - 3) Motion module: This module receives the desired actions from the behavior modules and generates motion commands. It considers factors, such as robot kinematics, dynamics, and environmental constraints, to plan and execute the robot's movements. - 4) Control module: The control module receives the motion commands from the motion module and generates control signals to actuate the robot's motors and actuators. It ensures precise and coordinated movement of the robot, controlling aspects, such as velocity, acceleration, and joint angles. - 5) Gripping and cutting module: This module handles the gripping and cutting mechanisms of the robot using grippers, cutting tools, etc. It receives control signals from the control module to perform precise manipulation and cutting actions on the tomatoes. - 6) Communication interface: This module provides a means of communication between the robot and external systems. It allows for remote monitoring, control, and coordination with a central control unit or user interface. It can use protocols, such as message queue telemetry transport (MQTT), robot operating system (ROS), or custom interfaces for exchanging data and commands.",
