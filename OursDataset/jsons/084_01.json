The burden of continuously delivering improved communication performance to support next-generation applications and services, combined with the increasing heterogeneity of systems and network technologies, has promoted the design of Congestion Control (CC) algorithms that perform well under specific environments. The challenge of designing a generic CC algorithm that can adapt to a broad range of scenarios is still an open research question. To tackle this challenge, we propose to apply a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach. Our solution, MARLIN, uses the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm to maximize both entropy and return and models the learning process as an infinite-horizon task. We trained MARLIN on a real network with varying background traffic patterns to overcome the sim-to-real mismatch that researchers have encountered when applying RL to CC. We evaluated our solution on the task of file transfer and compared it to TCP Cubic. While further research is required, results have shown that MARLIN can achieve comparable results to TCP with little hyperparameter tuning, in a task significantly different from its training setting. Therefore, we believe that our work represents a promising first step towards building CC algorithms based on the maximum entropy RL framework.",

While many studies have already shown promising results, they still underperform when compared to existing TCP CC algorithms in many scenarios. Reasons may include: difficulties to train RL agents and/or ML models using real networks and hardware; low fidelity of simulation and emulation environments; sub-optimal environment representation (state), action space, and/or reward function design; and delayed action effects on the state due to communications delay. Additional research is needed to address these problems.",

The critical impact of CC on the performance of distributed applications and services has led researchers and engineers to design many variants, each one with different target scenarios and trade-offs in terms of aggressiveness, responsiveness to loss and congestion, fairness, and friendliness [1, 2, 3]. However, the challenge of designing a generic CC algorithm that can provide nearoptimal performance in a broad range of network and traffic scenarios is still open.",
