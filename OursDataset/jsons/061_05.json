The photon flux variation in the reflection component ( $R_{\\rm P}$ - $R_{\\rm T}$ ) is roughly two times larger than that of the Compton component below  $\\sim$ 10 keV, and becomes less than 1/2 in the energy range above  $\\sim$ 100 keV. We then plotted the ratio between the photon flux variation of the reflection and the Compton component between the peak phase and the trough phase, in order to show relative contributions from the Compton and the reflection component to the X-ray variability with photon energy. The QPO fractional RMS below ~10 keV is also larger than that above  $\\sim 10$  keV (see Figure 4), which suggests that strong variation of the QPO flux at lower energy band is due to the reflection component. Since the photon flux variation of the reflection component is determined by the variation of  $norm \\times \\mathcal{R}$ , the dominated role of the reflection component below  $\\sim 10$  keV on the QPO flux variation can be understood as the parameter  $\\mathcal{R}$  of this observation is large.",

Starting from above  $\\sim 70$ keV, the flux variation between the peak phase and the trough phase is becoming primarily from the contribution of the *direct* Compton component. Beyond 100 keV or so, the contribution of the reflection component is negligible.

            "text": " J1820+070. The greatest change among spectral parameters between the two LFOPO phases is the normalization *norm*. The difference in the normalization represents the flux variation between the two phases in the primary Compton emission. In the energy range above  $\\sim 100$  keV, the Compton component overwhelmingly dominates over the reflection component, and thus the flux variation above  $\\sim 100$ between the peak and the trough phases is contributed by the Compton component alone (see Figure 4). Therefore, the underlying beats that generate the LFQPOs should originate from the Compton emission. Under the framework of conventional Comptonization models, the Compton component is thought to originate from a hot corona. Our spectral analysis shows that the corona is not oscillating coronal temperature or electron density, since in our spectral fits, the temperature  $kT_e$  and  $\\tau$  of the Compton component does not show apparent changes between those of the peak and the trough phases. Thus the LFQPO corresponds to a modulation in the photon flux of the Compton component, either through modulation of the seed photons or line-of-sight covering factor.",
