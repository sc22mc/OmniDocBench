This raises a fundamental question for anybody who wants to apply RL to the problem of CC: when should the next action be taken? While other similar approaches, like [16, 17], gather statistics during a fixed amount of time to compute the state and take the next action, MARLIN implements a different heuristic algorithm. Every time the transport protocol makes new network statistics available to MARLIN, if at least the last reported SRTT has elapsed since the time the last action was taken, data collected up to that time is refined, the reward  $r_t$  with regards to action  $a_{t-1}$  is assigned, a new state  $s_t$  is fed to the agent, and a new action  $a_t$  is taken. Waiting for at least one SRTT between actions prevents that a new action is taken before the impact of the previous one can be sensed by the agent.",

Relying on real hardware and protocol implementation intrinsically diversifies training experience thanks to the stochasticity of the environment and it prevents the agent from overfitting on artificial patterns that would not be found in the real world.",

Roughly 87% of the background traffic in our testbed is made by elephant flows, consisting of four different flows that alternate each other over the link every two seconds, and two mice flows, which continuously generate very short-lived (in the order of milliseconds) traffic bursts with intervals that follow a Poisson distribution.",

Further details regarding Mockets are presented in Section III. To avoid running into situations where MARLIN could underperform due to the protocol implementation, we shaped the network scenario around the typical Mockets use case for this first iteration. We set a Smart Queue policy on the router to limit the maximum amount of traffic flowing between the two subnetworks to 250 KB/s; we also used TC NetEm - Traffic Control Network Emulator (TC-NETEM) on the \"Sender Application\" node to introduce 100 ms of latency and 3% random packet loss that only affect the traffic generated by the application. Note that the router's manual reports that it effectively limits the actual rate to 95% of the specified value when Smart Queue is enabled [18].",
