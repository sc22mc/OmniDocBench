More interestingly, there is no XMCD at the Te  $M_{4,5}$  edges either (Fig. S7a), which is in contrast to results in the closely related V- and Cr-doped  $(Bi,Sb)_2Te_3$  [\\[39–42\\]](#page-3-3), and which might indicate differences in the magnetic interactions of both compounds.  Next we focus on the Mn  $L_{2,3}$  edge. Due to the shallow escape depth, the topmost SL contributes the most to the signal. However, even for SL termination, the FM Mn sheet is buried about  $0.55 \\text{ nm}$  below the surface, and significantly more for QL termination. Therefore, probing depth effects have to be considered, when interpreting the ordered magnetic moments obtained with XMCD (see secs. [II F](#) and [III](#)).

Within the precision allowed by the  $T$  increments of  $2 \\text{ K}$ , the transition temperatures at surface and bulk are consistent. We remark that the transition behavior as observed with SQUID and XMCD could differ somewhat due to the different measurement protocols: For XMCD, each point in Fig.  $4c$  was obtained after driving to  $\\mu_0 H = 3 \\text{ T}$  and back to remanence. In contrast, in SQUID measurements a conventional FC protocol at  $10 \\,\\mathrm{mT}$  was used.",
