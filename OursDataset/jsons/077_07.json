We train Timewarp on AD as described in Section 5 and sample new states using Algorithm 1 for a chain length of 10 million, accepting roughly  $2\\%$  of the proposals. In Figure 3a we visualise the samples using a Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963), which shows the distribution of the backbone dihedral angles  $\\varphi$  and  $\\psi$ . Each mode in the plot represents a metastable state. We see that the Timewarp samples closely match MD, visiting all the metastable states with the correct relative weights. In Figure 3b we plot the free energy (*i.e.*, the relative log probability) of the  $\\varphi$  and  $\\psi$ angles, again showing close agreement. The roughness in the plot is due to some regions of state space having very few samples. In Figure 3c we show, for an initial state  $x(t)$ , the conditional distribution of MD obtained by integrating Equation (2),  $\\mu(x(t+\\tau)|x(t))$ , compared with the model  $p_{\\theta}(x(t+\\tau)|x(t))$ , demonstrating close agreement.

After training on the train dipeptides, we deploy Timewarp with Algorithm 1 on the test dipeptides for a chain length of 20 million. Timewarp achieves acceptance probabilities between  $0.03\\%$  and  $2\\%$  and explores all metastable states (Appendix [B.1](#B.1)). The results are shown for the dipeptides QW and HT in Figure 4, showing close agreement between Timewarp and long MD chains (1  $\\mu$ s =  $2 \\times 10^9$  timesteps). For these dipeptides, Timewarp achieves ESS/s speed-up factors over MD of 5 and 33 respectively (Appendix [B.4](#B.4)). In Figure 5, Left, we show the speed-up factors for Timewarp *versus* MD for each of the 100 test dipeptides. Timewarp provides a median speed-up factor of about five across these peptides. In addition, we generate samples with the Timewarp model without the MH correction as detailed in Section 3.5. We sample 100 parallel chains for only 10000 steps starting from the same initial state for each test peptide. For each peptide we select *only one* of these chains that finds all meta-stable states for evaluations. As before, we compute the ESS/s to compare with MD, showing a median speedup factor of  $\\approx 600$  (Figure 5c). Note that the actual speedup when using all the chains sampled in parallel will be much larger. Timewarp exploration leads to free energy estimates that are qualitatively similar to MD, but less accurate than Timewarp MCMC (Figure 4b).",
