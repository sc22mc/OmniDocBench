(2023), the LLM must be tuned to work with generated summary vectors and its training is sophisticated as it involves recursive compression. In contrast, we propose a very simple, straightforward and scalable approach to generating memory slots that can be used in the target LLM with different prompts for various purposes. Moreover, our approach is much more parameter-efficient (i.e., LoRA) for tuning on top of the existing LLM. Additionally, some recent work studies how to compress prompts into more concise natural language (Jiang et al., 2023a), and approaches the context limit with divide-and-conquer methodology (Bertsch et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Song et al., 2024).",
