The OCV sampling circuit is a high-impedance resistive divider that samples 50% of the steady-state (i.e., after cell rest) OCV into the dc/dc's MPP reference voltage capacitor. The resistive divider is briefly connected to the circuit thanks to the wakeup signal, and then it is unconnected through two switches. The IPSP acts as the interface between the PMFC and the sensor node and has a twofold purpose. First, it turns the power flow on/off from the PMFC to the dc/dc input, to either *harvest* energy from the cell or to *unload* it to ensure cell recovery. Second, the IPSP also controls whether the PMFC is being used as a power source (i.e., PMFC connected to the DC/DC), or if it is being used as  $\\frac{1}{2}$ EIS biosensor (i.e., PMFC connected to the EIS AFE).",

Fig. 2 shows the time development of the supply voltages of the IPSP, the sampling, and the storage capacitor during an entire application cycle. The OCV sampling section is powered only at the start of the wakeup period. On the other hand, the IPSP is activated only once OCV has been successfully sampled so as not to disrupt its measurement by loading the PMFC before time. To grant the synchronization between these two phases, the wakeup harvesting circuitry charges two separate capacitors, one responsible for OCV sampling ( $C_{SMP}$ ) and one for the IPSP's supply ( $C_{WK}$ ).  $C_{SMP}$  must activate and deactivate OCV sampling strictly before  $C_{WK}$  activates IPSP, so that sampling ends before harvesting begins [see Fig. 2(A)]. This can be done by properly sizing  $C_{SMP}$  and  $C_{WK}$ , with  $C_{WK} > C_{SMP}$ . The IPSP also taps into the storage capacitor when  $C_{WK}$  is depleted to sustain harvesting beyond the wakeup period. In particular, to ensure correct supply handoff,  $C_{WK}$  must be able to hold the IPSP's supply above its operative voltage (1.65 V) as the storage capacitor charges above its load-enable threshold,  $V_{MIN} = 2 V$  [see Fig. 2(B)]. If the PMFC cannot charge the storage capacitor above  $V_{MIN}$  in time, harvesting cannot continue as the IPSP is unpowered. The cell is deemed inactive, and a new wakeup tentative will be done at the next wakeup message reception.",

After that, we moved on to analyzing the time development of the impedance spectra of active and inactive PMFCs: with this experiment, we confirm that the impedance spectrum of a PMFC varies significantly both from day to day and from active and inactive plants. These significant changes in EIS results can be tracked to more than just common MFC parameters, such as biofilm formation, but also to plant health and status. We executed this first set of EIS measurements with a reference potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT302 N) for three consecutive days. These first EIS measurements also allowed us to set up the MAX30134's measurement range for PMFCs. We then validated the MAX30134's capabilities in measuring a PMFC's impedance spectrum by comparing its measurements to the reference potentiostat and in terms of low-power energy consumption by measuring its energy consumption during a prototype EIS sweep. As a last step, we estimated the energy consumption of the atomic tasks of the application scenario we considered: message transmission and EIS measurement. This allowed us to dimension the energy storage element required for this test case and confirm the feasibility of a simple monitoring application based on this node.",

Once the measurement is finished, EIS circuitry is power-gated, and the MCU enters LPM 4.5 again, waiting until  $V_{TX}$  is reached. At that point, transmission is issued by powering the LoRa modem through the S signal. After the transmission, the MCU remains active until the storage element drops below  $V_{MIN}$ —5 mV. The BQ25505's internal PFET disconnects the storage element from the sensor node supply line at that voltage. This interrupts the power supply to the IPSP and all components, sending the node into rest mode until a new wakeup signal is received. To save precious leftover storage energy during cell rest, the BQ25505 is held in a reset state, only consuming 5 nA. If rest lasts a long time and the storage is discharged below the cold-start voltage ( $V_{CS} = 1.8$  V), we will incur in cold start of the DC/DC converter upon wakeup. Power distribution and component power-gating are done through SPST (Vishay Siliconix, SiP32431DN) and SPDT (Vishay Siliconix, DG4157E) switches.",
