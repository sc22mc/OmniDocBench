Our method with a moderate configuration (flexible- $\\tau$ , test  $\\tau = 0.15$ ) still performed comparably to CA  $(N = 2)$  and outperformed CA  $(N = 1)$ , full-4D, JAEC, and LA. Our method (flexible- $\\tau$ ) was also stable over a wide range of  $\\tau$ . As shown in Fig. 5. our method (flexible- $\\tau$ ) consistently ( $\\tau \\in [0.075, 0.275]$ ) outperformed the other imaging methods that can complete the measurement in a single exposure (CA  $(N = 1)$ , JAEC, and LA).",
