After five iterations, BoT aggregates multiple such analyses, deriving a more potent prompt, making the LLMs select the right numbers 9 and 7. Also, the advice is more concrete and useful. The advice for this right selection is to increase the corresponding evaluation score. Through the continuous accumulation such *experiences*, BoT progressively refines the prompt, culminating in the direct generation of a correct solution in the 8-th iteration.",

By doing so, LLM is able to perform a more meaningful analysis on a stronger thought chain, thus producing important experiences to enhance the prompt. As shown in Table 4, once the Greedy aggregation is used, BoT improves by more than  $2\\%$  in all cases. In AOuA, containing more math problems, this number is even  $10\\%$ . Besides, as our discussion in Fig. 4, ToT with a similar experience-driven boosting mechanism reaches  $80\\%$  but still lags behind the BoT.
