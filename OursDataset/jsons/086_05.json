This type of sensor requires no movement of the sensor or the measured objects, primarily dependent upon the exposure time. Compared to the push and whisk broom sensors, filter-based sensors are fast for image acquisition and can be used to detect specific diseases (diseases that disrupt the chlorophyll content of leaves) [\\[15\\]](#page-9-1), [\\[36\\]](#page-9-1), [39]. However, the disadvantage of filter-based sensors is that the spectral resolution is often low as they can only obtain specific bands of the electromagnetic spectrum [\\[15\\]](#page-9-1) On the other hand, snapshot sensors do not need to scan an object to form a hypercube. They are developed based on the principle operation of traditional RGB cameras (mosaic principle). The advantage of a snapshot camera is that it can provide a higher number of image recordings than the aforementioned ones. They are compact in size, require less time to obtain images, and can be used for moving objects [with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]. The obtained information from snapshot sensors exhibits characteristics of plant diseases, as the difference in light absorption and reflectance aids the plant disease detection and classification [\\[40\\]](#page-9-1). However, the spatial resolution for this type of sensor is very low compared to the traditional sensors [17]. Within the context of plant disease detection, push broom and whisk broom imaging sensors are suitable to be used in aerial and satellite-based studies as they have higher spectral resolution and can capture information from large areas/open fields. For targeted disease detection, and if the spectral profile of the disease is known, then filter sensors are the best choice to be used. Similar to push broom and whisk broom sensors, snapshot sensors can also be used for large areas/fields, as they can capture important information from the",

A linear stage, trucks, or scaffolds are used as the platform to mount the hyperspectral imaging sensors. The platforms are flexible and can be used in fields and greenhouses. For outdoors, the sun is considered the light source, while the images are captured, whereas halogen lamps are considered the light source for the indoors, such as greenhouse environment  $[42]$ .
