Also taking into account some ambiguity in the choice of the XAS background due to the rather featureless but intense tails of the preceding Te  $M_{4,5}$  edges allows us to estimate the errors (sec.

However, the shallow probing depth can further bias the outcome (sec. IID and ref. [\\[55\\]](#page-9-1)): It is reasonable to expect that the QLs and the outer  $(6c)$  positions of the SLs might contain slightly canted Mn, as well as a few percent of paramagnetic and possibly even AFM (with respect to the  $3a$  positions) Mn, see sec. II A, sec. III and Fig. 1. Already for SL surface termination, the FM ordered Mn sheet  $(3a \\text{ positions})$  is buried about  $0.55 \\text{ nm}$  below the surface. At the same time, there is Mn in  $6c$  positions closer to the surface, both in the very same SL and in QLs, which can terminate the surface in different parts of the sample. Therefore, already for a mean probing depth (MPD) of about 1 nm, the contribution of the FM Mn would be notably suppressed. MPD values between 1 and 2.5 have been reported for this photon energy range [\\[56, 57\\]](#page-9-1). Given the presence of the Te",

Additional surface effects might influence magnetism and therefore warrant consideration. First of all, the incomplete out-of-plane coordination by magnetic neighbors of the topmost SL suppresses the out-of-plane magnetic interactions and interrupts the exchange paths of the antisite Mn ions. However, since these interlayer interactions are weak (sec. IIC), additional theoretical scrutiny would be required to elucidate, what role their further suppression might play. Second, a competition between the demagnetizing field and the crystalline anisotropy might result in a canting and a suppression of the XMCD signal - an effect which must, however, be small due to our finding of a strong out-of-plane anisotropy, see sec. IID and the inset of Fig. 4a. Third, a combined study involving DFT and XMCD suggests that TSS couple to magnetic atoms such as Co and Mn at the surface of  $\\text{Bi}_2\\text{Te}_3$ , contributing to their interaction by a RKKY-like mechanism [\\[59\\]](#page-): Due to their highly localized nature, electrons in the TSS interact more strongly with magnetic moments than electrons in the bulk. This might contribute to the differences between the magnetic properties at the surface and in the bulk. Our results encourage similar calculations for  $\\text{MnBi}_6\\text{Te}_{10}$ . Finally, the interaction with the TSS might also result in a slight helical canting away from the out-of-plane orientation, driven by Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interactions [\\[60, 61\\]](#page-).
