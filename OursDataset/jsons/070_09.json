IV) for  $\\text{MnBi}_{6}\\text{Te}_{10}$  to those of Refs. 23, 33, and 34 reveal differences in dwelling times, the starting and quenching temperatures, and the composition of a melt, which may well account for the various intermixing patterns. In general, we observe reproducible Mn concentrations and magnetic behavior in our  $\\text{MBT}_{2}$  crystals (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4) for an applied tempering profile [\\[31, 74\\]](#page-9-1), suggesting that the cation intermixing is a temperature-regulated phenomenon. We do not argue that this process is fully governed by the thermodynamics, since crystallization of the  $\\text{MBT}_{n}$  from a heterogeneous melt is strongly kinetics-driven. Yet it seems plausible, that the resulting intermixing pattern is governed by a given synthetic protocol. Strong correlations between the synthesis temperatures and the resultant cation disorder and magnetic order have been, by now, undoubtedly established at least for  $\\text{MnSb}_{2}\\text{Te}_{4}$  [\\[62, 74, 75\\]](#page-9-1).
