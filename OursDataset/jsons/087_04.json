The object will take a trip to some destination and may perform an activity there. E.g., The operator drives the machinery from the depot [trip], to a field [destination], and bales [activity], in that field. This example scenario illustrates that field segmentation could be observed as a vehicle trajectory segmentation problem. However, when the fields are adjacent, such as that illustrated in Fig.  $2(a)$ , the trip segment between activities is significantly reduced, which may complicate the segmentation process.",

Moreira and Santos [45] devised an approach to obtain the convex or concave hull perimeter of a given set of points using a k-nearest neighbours approach. In a concave shape, a straight line can be drawn between two points within the shape, that goes out of bounds. The set of conjoined fields shown in Fig.  $2(a)$  delineate a concave shape. When applying the algorithm presented in [45], users must tune the  $k$  parameter to adapt the shape of polygons output by the algorithm.

            "text": " Zhang et al. [37] trained two decision tree algorithms from European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) and real-time kinematic (RTK) trajectory datasets containing three field plots each. The authors conclude that the model trained using RTK data is most effective for field segmentation. Chen et al. [38] designed and trained a graph convolutional network (GCN). The developed method was validated by the harvesting trajectories of two crops, wheat and paddy. GCNbased road-to-field classification achieved 88.14% and 85.93% accuracy for the wheat data and the paddy data, respectively. Comparisons made by the authors demonstrated that the developed method consistently outperformed the current state-of-theart road-to-field classification methods by  $1.9\\%$  for the wheat data and 5.7% for the paddy data.",

            "text": " However, test cases shown in all previous works  $[34]$ ,  $[35]$ , [36], [37], [38] do not include conjoined field segmentation conditions as illustrated in Fig.  $2(a)$ , only road-to-field cases. Instances of isolated fields, connected by a road in between, may be solved using a Hall effect sensor for cases of towed implements. These sensors can be purchased for under €5 [50]. This is sufficient to detect when the PTO is active and the implement is mechanically powered, which indicates, along with implement motion, that the machine is interacting with the crop. The inverse is true when the PTO is inactive and the implement is in motion, which allows for the detection of road travel. Thus, a significant challenge in coordinate-based field segmentation remains in solving for conjoined, field-tofield cases when the operator moves between adjacent fields connected by short, off-road pathways. This is one of the key",

These are layered on top of episodes to derive context from the trajectory. Elements of this approach could be useful, like establishing a home geo-fence for the machinery. Acquiring land use and road network data may not be practical in remote locations, however, and may require the acquisition of sensitive personal information. Guo et al. [46] offered an approach to segment on-road vehicle global positioning system (GPS) trajectory data using probabilistic logic on vehicle data and positional data. The method relies on vehicle CANbus and GPS data, in addition to historical business data (e.g., delivery service transportation), to group repetitive driving patterns. Agricultural machinery contractors usually have irregular schedules that are difficult to predict due to weather conditions and time constraints involved in harvesting.",
