The main reason is that the generated wrong reasoning steps will be further analyzed to produce new experiences to be added to the prompt. Specifically, as these reasoning steps contain obvious mistakes that are easy to identify, LLMs are prone to generating correct error analysis and providing effective advice for revisions. With this new experience included in the prompt, BoT is capable of generating correct reasoning steps. As demonstrated by the experience in Table 8, BoT produces detailed error reports and revision suggestions, resulting in a rational thought generation process illustrated in Table 7.",
