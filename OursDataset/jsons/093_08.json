This is due to the fact that the detected blobs are filtered out if their size is much larger than that assigned to the presence of a BMSB (overlapping increases the blob size). Thus, considering previously captured data and detected insects plays a significant role that impacts the system performance. To evaluate the impact of insects overlapping each other, we made some alterations to the dataset by removing the images that exceeded seven days between trap replacement. This time interval was selected based on the frequency of new insects being captured on the trap. This led to a significant reduction in error by decreasing the MAE from 2.07 to 1.05 and mse from 13.55 to 1.81. It also increased the recall by almost 10%. These results prove the impact of envisaging overlapping on the performance and that the recent changes in the algorithmic process are in the right direction to improve the efficiency of the system.",

We use the term \"almost\" because the detection does not occur in real time; it starts after the clients take pictures. A client can be any device equipped with a camera (such as smartphones, tablets, or drones) and network connectivity. The app consists of two main components: a *server* and a *client*. The server hosts the trained models discussed in Section III and listens to requests sent by one or more clients. The concept of request splits into two different manners: API request or GUI request. Upon receiving a request, the client sends the captured images to the server for evaluation using one of the various ML algorithms stored within. Once the server completes processing the request, it responds to the client by transmitting the potential bug detections in the form of bounding box coordinates, along with their associated confidence levels. At the client level, also autonomous UAVs can perform these requests. The architecture of the clientâ€“server app is depicted in Fig.  $5$ .",
