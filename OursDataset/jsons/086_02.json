Every pixel in an image is assigned to spectral data that span a broad range of individual wavelengths [\\[12\\]](#page-9-1). Hyperspectral cameras operate within 250-2500 nm, which covers ultraviolet (UV), visible, and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum [\\[7\\]](#page-9-1). The advantage of hyperspectral cameras is that they help to focus on a specific part of images or area of interest, which contains the anomalies (e.g., unhealthy/diseased parts of a plant leaf). This helps to establish special patterns or features to analyze the anomalies/diseases [\\[10\\]](#page-9-1). The multispectral camera operates differently than the hyperspectral cameras. Instead of using hundreds of individual wavelengths, the multispectral camera operates within ranges of wavelengths. Multispectral imaging uses a camera to create images in specific wavelength regions, while multispectral spectroscopy provides data about specific frequency bands. Multispectral cameras have the advantage of being more cost-effective compared to hyperspectral techniques. However, they capture less detailed information about the captured object (plant/leaf) because they use a wider frequency band [\\[10\\]](#page-9-1). Fluorescence cameras capture images of fluorescence. Fluorescence images have higher dimensions than other imaging techniques. It can easily isolate the area of interest from the area of noninterest. However, they are not suitable for detecting early-stage diseases as the images lack clear differences between healthy and diseased plant tissues [\\[10\\]](#page-9-1). Thermal cameras are devised to capture radiation within the infrared wavelength spectrum. The collected data are then translated into false-color images, where each image pixel indicates a temperature value. However, thermal images are often influenced by fluctuating environmental conditions [\\[70\\]](#page-9-1). This makes them more suitable to be used in controlled environment conditions [\\[13\\]](#page-9-1).",

The spatial images and the spectroscopy in the hyperspectral image sensors aid in providing the physical, geometrical (size, shape, and color), and chemical composition. Apart from hyperspectral imaging, there are multispectral and ultraspectral spectral imaging techniques. All these spectral imaging techniques capture spectral images at different wavebands or within specific portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The only difference is that each spectral imaging operates in different electromagnetic spectrums and bands. Ultraspectral imaging operates in fine spectral resolution. Multispectral imaging operates in smaller bands, typically around 10–15 spectral bands. Depending upon a multispectral camera's specifications, it can sometimes capture even more than 15 spectral bands [19]. On the other hand, hyperspectral imaging can operate in the UV at 250–400 nm, visible and near-infrared (VNIR) at 400-1300 nm, and short-wave infrared (SWIR) at 1300–2500 nm. However, it cannot operate on other ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as  $X$ -rays or microwaves [7].",
