Thus, each thought structure of BoT is a shallow weighted binary tree. For simplicity, we retain the notation  $z_{1...i-1}$  to represent the thoughts from the root to the parent of node i. In addition to providing each node  $i$  with one thought  $z_i$  and its thought evaluation score  $V_i \\sim$  $p_{\\theta}(z_{1...i}, \\mathbb{I}_a, X, Q)$ , we incorporate the edge score  $V_{i-1,i} \\sim p_{\\theta}(z_{i-1}, z_i, \\mathbb{I}_e, X, Q)$  between a child node and its parent node, where  $\\mathbb{I}_a$  and  $\\mathbb{I}_e$  refer to the instructional descriptions for thought and edge evaluations.  $V_{i-1,i}$  represents the LLMs' confidence level in generating this reasoning step.

(2024), which seeks to search for a solution in one large and complex tree, BoT aims to build highly heterogeneous tree thought structures. As a result, complete reasoning chains with various logical in trees of BoT are subsequently assessed as *experience*. Therefore, to increase heterogeneity, thought structure generation embraces different tree growth strategies, such as level-wise growth and leaf-wise growth. The former emphasizes exploration but less exploitation Chen & Guestrin (2016), while the latter does the opposite Ke et al.  $(2017)$ . Thus, the leaf-wise strategy tends to continue reasoning from the current best thought to reach a better final thought as compared to level-wise growth, but it also tends to get monotonous reasoning chains. Besides, different temperature and Top\\_p settings of LLMs are applied. Finally, we use a small max\\_depth value in BoT and label a node as a leaf when its  $V_{i-1,i}$  and  $V_i$  values are outside the specified range  $[0.3, 0.8]$ .",

(2023) of LLMs to assess  $\\overline{z}_{1...n}$ . Specifically, with the prompt  $\\Pi_f^t$   $(\\overline{z}_{1...n}, X, Q)$  as input, LLM outputs a feedback paragraph containing issues report of this thought chain  $\\overline{z}_{1...n}$  and detailed advice. This feedback will be added to  $\\mathbf{F}^{1,\\dots,t-1}$  as a new *experience* in thought generation, resulting  $\\mathbf{F}^{1,\\dots,t}$ .",
