A study showed Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FDA) was used to detect powdery mildew and yellow rust on wheat crops using remote sensing hyperspectral images. Different wavelengths, such as 531, 570-654, and 687–717 nm, were selected to classify the diseases. The accuracy of the disease classification reached 93% [306]. Another popular statistical algorithm PCA is sometimes also used for disease classification. One such study can be found in [307], where the labeled image of cucumber leaves with downy mildew disease is used to perform the analysis. PCA is used to reduce the complexity of the hyperspectral images. This study only used 20 leaves (ten infected and ten healthy) to train and obtained  $90\\%$  detection accuracy [307]. However, this analysis might not be very suitable as the training with fewer hyperspectral images could result in biased results.",

One such study was conducted to assess the severity of rice blasts from the hyperspectral images [270]. At first, the average spectral reflectance of the hyperspectral images (healthy and diseased) was obtained. Then, by the SRR reconstruction method, the severity of the rice blast was ranked. Once the ranking is obtained, the images are fed to the SVM model to classify the diseases based on the development stages of rice (such as jointing, booting, and heading stages). The SRR reconstruction method proved effective for disease severity assessment during the later stage of the vegetative growth  $[270]$ .",

            "text": " A comparative analysis of hyperspectral images' spectral and temporal information can estimate plants' pathological stress. A study was conducted by Muhammed [310] to evaluate the fungal disease severity in wheat leaves. The crop reflectance data and complementary diseased leaf vectors are first normalized through bandwise and spectralwise normalization techniques. Then, kNN algorithms are applied to classify the types of wheat diseases. After the classification step, the images are fed to a linear transformation model so that the correlation factor can be obtained to define the severity rank of the diseases [310]. Spectral assessment and interpretation are also used to determine the disease severity assessment index. One such study was found in [296], where the disease severity of powdery mildew in wheat plants was estimated. A spectroradiometer evaluated the hyperspectral reflectance of the healthy and infected leaves in a laboratory setting. Nine ranks of disease severity scales were defined by using the disease index. Multivariate linear regression (MLR) and PLSR assessed the disease severity. Once the models were run and validation of the model was completed, the images were evaluated through the relative root-mean-square error (RMSE) metric. Results show that the PLSR model had lower relative RMSE and a higher coefficient of determination score than MLR models [296].",

Therefore, a quantitative plant disease assessment is critical for hyperspectral image analysis. Disease index is a function of disease incidence and disease severity. For example, for wheat Fusarium head blight, i.e.,  $FHB \\ index = incidence \\times severity$ . In addition, water content, pigment content, and pathogen types and symptoms are used as indirect evaluation indices [\\[17\\]](#page-17-1).",
