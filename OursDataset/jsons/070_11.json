Prior to the measurements, each sample was mechanically cleaved in the fast-entry chamber at a pressure of  $\\sim 10^{-9}$  mbar to expose a pristine surface. The sample was then transferred into the spectroscopy chamber with a pressure in the  $10^{-11} - 10^{-10}$    The measurements were carried out in the TEY or FY mode at magnetic fields of up to 6T and at various temperatures in the 3.5–35 K range. The temperature was calibrated with a thermal sensor mounted at the sample position before the experiment. Especially below about 5 K, the actual sample temperature crucially depends on the thermal contact, increasing its error as compared to higher temperatures. The spectral intensity was normalized by the incoming photon intensity ( $I_0$ ). We used circularly polarized light at both beamlines. The area probed by the beam at both facilities (about 120×80µm²) was much smaller than the sample size.",

Our results are in good agreement with values reported for (Ga,Mn)As [\\[89-93\\]](#page-9-1) and Mn-doped Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> [\\[55\\]](#page-9-1) and Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> [\\[94\\]](#page-9-1).

To simplify the calculation, instead of the trigonal C<sub>3v</sub> we work in O<sub>h</sub> symmetry, with the C<sub>4</sub> octahedral axes along the Mn-Te bonds, which has a negligible impact: Our simplification neglects the splitting of the t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals, which is tiny compared to  $10Dq < 100 \\text{ meV}$ , which in turn is smaller than the experimental resolution.",

The XAS intensity  $I$ , after background correction (sec. S.V-A), is integrated over  $L_{2,3}$  to yield  $r$ .  $\\langle T_z \\rangle$  is the expectation value of the intra-atomic magnetic dipole operator which is  $-0.0002\\hbar$  and hence negligible (sec. S.V-A). For  $n_d$  we use the MLFT value of 5.31 (sec. II E). Finally,  $C$  is a correction factor, which takes into account the considerable overlap of the  $L_3$  and  $L_2$  contributions for light transition metals. We use a value of  $C = 1.4$  (sec. S.V-A). To circumvent the difficulties related to this overlap, one can obtain  $m_{XM}^{spin}$  by a comparison of the experimental XMCD asymmetry at the  $L_3$  peak to the theoretical one calculated from MLFT spectra of comparable line width [\\[52–54\\]](#page-).V.
