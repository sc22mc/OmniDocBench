However, this is a long-term strategy. Finding disease-resistant rhizomes in ginger necessitates the use of an effective and trustworthy disease-screening technique. For instance, selection methods for locating resistance to bacterial wilt in ginger plants were investigated in [49]. This includes pseudostem inoculation, rhizome inoculation, soil inoculation, and an in vitro method. The result of the study shows that the soil inoculation method outperformed the other methods due to its simplicity and large-scale adoption in a short time for bacterial wilt resistance in ginger.",

They provide increased accuracy and efficiency of disease management operations while reducing labor costs. This promotes sustainable farming practices by minimizing the environmental impact of agriculture through precise application of inputs.
