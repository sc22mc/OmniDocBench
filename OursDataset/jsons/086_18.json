However, one common challenge for computer-aided algorithms is that it requires good quality and a large amount of data to process the hyperspectral images. If a smaller dataset is used, the results might be biased and unable to detect the diseases well. Therefore, during the data acquisition period, a good-quality camera and a large amount of data (approximately 10k above) should be collected so that the models do not face overfitting issues.",

In addition, machine learning techniques for regression and classification (such as SVM or RF) can increase the need for high computational power and time. This reduces the chance of being implemented in real-time/resource-limited settings, such as crop monitoring  $[319]$ ,  $[320]$ .

The current systems are capable of detecting diseases when they are visibly infested. Hence, developing remote sensing platforms that can monitor the disease growth at the emerging stages is crucial. The placement of sensors or the distance between the sensors and the diseased plants is one of the crucial factors for image analysis. This is because the distance of the sensor is directly related to the spatial resolution",
