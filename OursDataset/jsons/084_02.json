It is inconvenient for the agent to overfit its trajectories on a fixed amount of bytes to transfer, or a fixed episode length, such that it will try to find a terminal state at any cost in a certain number of timesteps. Instead, we aim at designing RL agents able to work on \"crowded\" links and achieve high channel utilization independently from the volume of data transferred during training. For such reason, training is based on infinite-horizon tasks, never encountering a terminal state and following the Partial Episode Bootstrapping (PEB) principles for infinitehorizon training presented in [12].",

This process follows the environment dynamics described by the probability function  $p(s_{t+1}, r_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) : S \\times R \\times S \\times A \\longrightarrow [0, 1].$  Such formulation of the transition dynamics also defines the *Markov* property, which requires the state to include all the relevant information about past interactions that would impact the future, as each possible values of  $r_t \\in R$  and  $s_t \\in S$  depend solely on the previous state and action  $s_{t-1}, a_{t-1}$ .",
