We also observed a non-temperature response of surrounding electrochemical sensors on presence of meditators in all cases, however, detecting the exact begin and end of exercises, as shown in Fig. 7, was possible only in several attempts. Since this topic represents the focus of other works [29], [33], [34], it was not pursued further here. Control measurements were carried out a) in parallel to experimental sessions on separate calorimeters (as non-targeted sensors); b) during so-called 'empty sessions' (meditators were present but no sessions were conducted), several examples of control attempts are shown in Figs.  $10(a)$ -10(c).",

The temperature data depends essentially on behavior of a meditator, even small changes in position (during a 2-3 hour experiment) disturb a thermodynamic equilibrium of the body and are reflected in an increasing or decreasing trend of  $t$ . Temperature dynamics depends on a fat content of tissues, clothing, room temperature and other factors that affect thermodynamic conditions. Therefore, experiments have been performed in a fixed position of a meditator, providing enough time for stabilizing body temperature before and after attempts. Fig. 5 demonstrates several experiments with raising or lowering body temperature through meditative visualization in ASC. We observe an almost immediate response of body temperature to the visualization, the area of persistent changes after the session is clearly visible; its duration is longer than the session itself.
