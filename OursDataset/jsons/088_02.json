Crop variability can include differences in size, shape, and texture, which can impact the robot's ability to identify and pick crops. - 3) *Obstacles and terrain:* Agricultural fields can have various obstacles and terrains, such as rocks, trees, and uneven ground. These uncertainties make it difficult for robots to navigate and avoid obstacles. - 4) *Sensor and hardware limitations:* Robotic systems require sensors and hardware to operate effectively. However, these components can have limitations in terms of accuracy, precision, and range. These uncertainties can impact the overall performance of the robot. - 5) *Data quality and quantity:* Agricultural data can be difficult to collect and may vary in quality and quantity. This uncertainty can impact the robot's ability to make informed decisions. - 6) Regulatory challenges: Agricultural robots must comply with various regulations and standards set by governments and other regulatory bodies.

AAVs are equipped with advanced sensors and cameras that can capture high-resolution images and provide real-time data on crop health, growth, and yield. AAVs are particularly useful for large farms and fields where manual monitoring and inspection can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. - 3) Autonomous underwater robot (AUR): These robots are a type of agricultural robot designed to operate underwater, performing tasks, such as monitoring water quality, inspecting aquaculture facilities, and conducting oceanographic research. - 4) *Autonomous arm robot (AAR):* An AAR for agriculture is a type of robotic system used in agricultural operations, such as planting, harvesting, pruning, and spraying. The arm can be mounted on a ground vehicle or mobile base or ariel vehicle that can navigate across fields and orchards.",
