            "text": " To demonstrate the methodology, we consider a negative basis position in our fund XAIA Credit Basis II on Lumen Technologies Inc. On 21 May 2021 we bought 4 mm USD bond and matched CDS protection (so-called bullet basis package). The EUR PnL of this position until 17 March 2022 is strongly positive by 313,710 EUR, but mainly because the USD has appreciated with respect to the EUR, with the EUR-USD exchange rate falling from 1.22 to 1.1. Indeed, the number  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(\\chi)$  equals 328, 220 EUR. The carry  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(\\text{carry})$  equals 47,568 EUR and the PnL due to market risk changes  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(x)$  amounts to 79,746 EUR, so that their sum  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(\\text{carry}) + P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(x)$  equals around 127, 310 EUR. This PnL is essentially due to consumption and tightening of the negative bond-CDS basis, see [Mai (2019)] for background. Since interest rates have risen significantly in the considered time period, the PnL  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(r)$  due to interest rate changes is negative and amounts to -141, 820 EUR. Finally, the transaction costs due to the purchase on 21 May 2021 equals 6,268 EUR in this example. In our fund XAIA Credit Basis II we hedge away interest rate risk and FX risk, in order to isolate the PnL  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(\\text{carry}) + P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(x)$  (minus transaction costs). In the considered time period, our FX hedge has lost money and our interest rate hedge has gained money. The number  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(\\text{carry}) + P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(x)$  (minus transaction costs) is around 121,042 EUR, which is more than 3% gain in nominal terms within less than one year. This is essentially the PnL from this trade that enters the fund's net asset value. In contrast, the (negative) PnL  $P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(\\text{carry}) + P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(x) + P_{(t,T]}^{(A)}(r)$  (minus transaction costs) is essentially what's depicted in the folder “Result curr. global” in our front office system SOPHIS. Figure 1 summarizes these numbers.",
