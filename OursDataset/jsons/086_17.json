The spectral indices provide much information, such as relative water content in tissue, chlorophyll pigments, and biochemical activity. The hyperspectral images captured at the 750â€“900 nm range could provide the phenotype to resist the diseases in grapevines  $[171]$ . A study regarding powdery mildew resistance in barley cultivars was conducted by Kuska et al. [311]. Every day, the reflection of healthy and infected leaves was recorded using the hyperspectral camera at  $400-700$  nm in the visible range and  $700-1000$  nm in the infrared range for two weeks. The study shows that resistant leaves increased the reflection level compared to the other healthy leaves in the visible wavelength range.

This is because the biochemical analysis is not taken into account. The hyperspectral images can potentially find the active pathogen and stress components because they can operate within limited wavelength bands  $[313]$ . To combat these issues, higher spatial resolution can be used to detect pathogens more accurately. In addition, auxiliary data such as soil information, meteorological, and field management data can be used to detect the abiotic and biotic stress levels in the plants  $[16]$ .",

However, the spectral reflectance methods may be highly sensitive to factors other than disease presence, such as water content, chlorophyll pigments, and biochemical activities. This sensitivity could affect the accuracy of disease detection  $[171]$ . Hence, it is essential to calibrate the hyperspectral imaging systems under consistent environmental/weather conditions and conduct extensive testing under various conditions to understand how factors like water content, chlorophyll pigments, and biochemical activities might affect the reflectance values. The studies above also show that they are limited to the effectiveness of the infrared spectrum [311]. To overcome this problem, multiple wavelength ranges in the visible and NIR spectra can be explored to know which wavelengths are most informative for disease detection.",
