For instance, the far-range platforms and airborne and spaceborne systems have deficient spatial resolution information compared to the closeranged systems. The sensors, which have a spatial resolution of 1 m [334], are not suitable for detecting infected/diseased plants. The higher the distance will be, the lower the sensitivity of the sensors will be. Although some studies have attempted to conduct transfer-learning-based studies at different scales, sufficient studies should be conducted to comprehend the scalability issue of close-range, greenhouse, commercial fields, and remote imaging. The camera calibration is also a vital parameter for mapping the spectral information [15], [335]. Therefore, with advanced sensor technologies, platforms, and algorithms for plant disease detection and diagnosis, it is anticipated that hyperspectral imaging could be an essential tool to analyze plant disease, phenotype, and genotypes. This will improve the applications for high-throughput studies.",
