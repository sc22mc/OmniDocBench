However, its production faces significant challenges due to pests and diseases, which can lead to substantial yield losses. Traditional methods for detecting these threats often rely on visual inspection by human experts, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. This article examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to address these limitations and transform ginger cultivation. It provides a comprehensive analysis of conventional pest and disease management strategies, identifying their short comings and exploring the potential of emerging AI technologies, including the AI of things' applications, for accurate, efficient, and timely detection and control. By pinpointing the challenges and outlining promising avenues for future research, this study aims to equip agriculturists and researchers with the knowledge necessary to optimize ginger production, enhance food security, and foster sustainable farming practices.",

Existing literature has provided insight into the diseases affecting ginger detection of diseases and pests in ginger, and prevention techniques [31], [32], [33], [34].

An assessment conducted by the Institute of Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, identified the disease as a fungal infection, which is both air and soilborne. Similar disease outbreaks have been reported in other ginger-producing countries, including bacterial wilt in Kochi Prefecture, Japan [6], Ethiopia [7], Queensland, Australia [8], and China [8]. Early detection and prediction could have prevented this immense economic loss. These incidents highlight the global nature of ginger diseases and underscore the urgent need for effective disease management strategies to protect ginger crops worldwide. Unfortunately, traditional human-based methods for visually monitoring ginger plants can be inefficient due to factors, such as weather conditions, workload, fatigue, and human error [9], [10]. Furthermore, the use of human experts can be costly for small farmers, time-consuming, and a very tedious task  $[10]$ . Hence, the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and the use of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) tools for plant disease detection have become an active research area.",
